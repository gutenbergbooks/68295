<h3>
CHAPTER I.
<br /><br />
THE PURSUIT.
</h3>

<p>
A new emotion&mdash;a hot thirst for blood&mdash;was
in the heart of Florian now; his whole
nature seemed to have undergone a sudden
and temporary change; and to those who
could have seen him his face would have been
found deadly pale, and his dark eyes full of
sombre fury.
</p>

<p>
The longing for retribution and destruction
was keen in his mind at that time.  Often he
reined up the horse he rode to take a steady
shot between the animal's quivering ears at
one or other of the two desperadoes; but
always missed them, and found that time was
thus lost and the distance increased.
</p>

<p>
His present charger was not so steady as
the old Cape nag, Tattoo, and Florian's
hands, in the intensity of his excitement,
trembled too much for his aim to be true; so
the fugitives rode on and on, without firing a
shot in return, thus showing that their
ammunition had been expended, and they had
nothing to hope for or trust to but a
successful escape.
</p>

<p>
A cry left Florian's lips as the fugitives
disappeared into a donga, and he thought he
had lost them; but anon he saw them ascending
the opposite slope at a rasping pace.
</p>

<p>
He could only think of the generous and
chivalrous Vivian Hammersley, that good
officer and noble Englishman, shot down thus
in the pride of his manhood by the felon
hand of an assassin, whose bullet was meant
for himself&mdash;Hammersley, whose form stood
with a kind of luminous atmosphere amid the
dark surroundings that beset them both since
he (Florian) had come as a soldier to Zululand;
and then he thought of Dulcie's friend
Finella, whom he only knew by name.
</p>

<p>
Poor girl! the next mail for Britain might
bring sorrowful tidings to her, with the very
letter his hand had so recently indited, full of
hope and expressions of happiness.
</p>

<p>
Crossing by flying leaps the Umvutshini
stream, a tributary of the greater Umvolosi,
the pursuers and pursued traversed an
undulating tract of country, scaring a great troop
of the brindled gnu, which were grazing
quietly there; anon a terrified herd of the
koodoo&mdash;graceful antelopes, with magnificent
spiral horns&mdash;swept past them, where the
karoo shrubs and the silvery hair-grass and
wild oats grew; elsewhere their horses' hoofs,
as they crushed or bruised the creeping
fibrous roots of the Akerrania, shed a
fragrance in the air.
</p>

<p>
The Umvolosi had now to be waded
through near a rocky kop which towered on
the right hand, and the opposite bank had to
be scrambled up at a place where the
tree-fern flourished thickly, and drooping
date-palms overhung the water.
</p>

<p>
Next they had to cross a nameless tributary
of the Upoko River, and then to skirt
the base of the Mabenge Mountains (within
two miles of Fort Newdigate), where, in
some places, an odour, sickly and awful, loaded
the evening air; and by experience they
knew it came from the bodies of slain Zulus
lying unburied, or covered only by their
shields and a few loose stones.
</p>

<p>
In some places&mdash;one particularly&mdash;Florian
and his companions found their progress
almost arrested by spiky plants of giant
size&mdash;the Doornboom, with its ox-horn-like
prickles; for there are thickets of those
through which even horses cannot pass&mdash;odious
and terrible plants which tear the
clothes to rags, and pierce the flesh to the
bone; but they discovered two breaches
through which the fugitives had passed, and,
forcing a passage, they rode onward again,
and, in the fierce ardour of pursuit, Florian
was all unconscious, till afterwards, how he
and his horse too were lacerated, scratched,
and torn by the sharp spines as he rushed
through them at full speed.
</p>

<p>
One of the fugitives had evidently found a
cartridge, in a pocket perhaps, for he fired
one shot rearward, in Parthian fashion, but
fruitlessly, as it hit no one, and then he rode
wildly but steadily on.
</p>

<p>
Believing that if ever he returned to camp
it would only be to find his friend dying or
dead, Florian, plunged in grief, maddened by
rage and a thirst for dire vengeance, rode
furiously yet silently on, closely followed by
his four infantry men.
</p>

<p>
His horse&mdash;Hammersley's&mdash;was a fine
English charger, and soon outstripped those
of his comrades, who erelong began to drop
rearward one after another, though Tom
Tyrrell continued to head the rest; but after
a time Florian found himself almost alone;
thus it was fortunate for him that those he
pursued were without ammunition.
</p>

<p>
Once or twice he lost sight of them, as
dongas or eminences intervened, and then a
low cry would escape him; but by the aid
of his field-glass he 'spotted' them again,
and gored his horse with the spurs anew.
</p>

<p>
Now broad before them lay the foaming
Nondweni River, with the lion-shaped hill of
Isandhlwana about seven miles distant, its
rocky crest then reddened by the western sun,
and Florian knew that now the pursuit had
lasted for more than twenty miles from the
Euzangonyan Hill.
</p>

<p>
Here the assassins reined up, and seemed
to confer for a moment or two, as if in
evident confusion and dismay.  To remain
was to die, and to attempt to cross the
river would end in death by drowning, it
was so deep and swift, red and swollen by
recent storms of such rain as falls in the tropics
only.
</p>

<p>
Florian dismounted now, dropped a fresh
cartridge into the breech-block of the rifle
he still carried, and just as he threw the
bridle over his arm, Tom Tyrrell came
tearing up and also leaped from his saddle,
prepared to fire at four hundred yards
range.
</p>

<p>
The two fugitives plunged into the water,
where trees, branches, cartloads of enormous
leaves and yellow pumpkins were being
swept past, and strove to make their horses
breast the stream by turning them partly at
an angle to the current.  More than once
the animals snorted with fear, throwing up
their heads wildly as their haunches went
down under the weight of their riders.
</p>

<p>
Tyrrell fired and shot one in mid-stream;
he threw up his hands in agony or despair,
and fell on the mane of his horse, which, with
himself, was swept round a rocky angle and
disappeared.
</p>

<p>
The other had gained footing on the opposite
bank, but at that moment Florian planted
a rifle bullet between his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
Sharply rang the report of the rifle, and a
shriek mingled with the rush of the world
of waters as the deserter and assassin fell
backward over the crupper of his struggling
horse, which gained the land, while his
rider sank to rise no more just as the last
red rays of the sun died out on the stern
hill-tops, and in its rush the river seemed to
sweep past with a mightier sound than ever.
</p>

<p>
<i>Which</i> of the two he had shot in the
twilight Florian knew not, nor did he care;
suffice it that he and Tom Tyrrell 'had
polished them off,' as the latter said, and
thereupon proceeded to light his pipe with an
air of profound contentment.
</p>

<p>
Hammersley was avenged, certainly.
</p>

<p>
Before setting out on his return, Florian
paused to draw breath, to wipe the cold
perspiration from his forehead, and nerve
himself anew for aught that might befall him
on his homeward way, for with tropical
speed darkness had fallen now, and he was
glad when he and Tyrrell overtook the three
mounted men, as they had a most lonely
district to traverse back to camp, and one
in which they were not likely to meet
friends; so they now rode somewhat slowly
on, breathing and enjoying what some one
calls the cool and mysterious wind of
night.
</p>

<p>
Zulus might be about in any number, with
rifle, assegai, and knobkerie; but though
Florian and his companions rode with arms
loaded as a precaution, they scarcely thought
of them, and were intent on comparing notes
and studying the features of the country as a
guide on their lonely way.
</p>

<p>
At last, with supreme satisfaction, after
many detours and mistakes, they saw the red
glowworm-like lights of the camp appearing
in the streets of tents, and knew thereby that
the last bugle had not sounded.
</p>

<p>
Ere long they heard the challenge of the
advanced sentinel of an outlying piquet, and
responding thereto, passed within the lines,
when Florian went at once to the headquarter
tents to report himself to the
Adjutant-General, together with the events
that had so recently transpired by the
Nondweni River.
</p>

<p>
'You have done precisely what the General
commanding would have ordered you to do,'
said the Adjutant-General, 'and I am sure
he will thank you for punishing the rascals
as they deserved.  There are too many
of "Cardwell's recruits" afloat in Cape
Colony!'
</p>

<p>
'Is Captain Hammersley still alive?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;but little more, I fear.'
</p>

<p>
He repaired straight to the sufferer's tent,
but was not permitted by the hospital
orderly, acting under the surgeon's strict
orders, to see him&mdash;or at least to speak with him.
</p>

<p>
The ball had broken some of the short ribs
on the left side, nearly driving them into the
lung; thus he was in a dangerous state.
Florian peeped into the bell-tent, and, by a
dim lantern hung on the pole thereof, could
see Hammersley lying on his camp-bed
asleep, apparently, and pale as marble; and
he thought it a sorrowful sight to see one
whose splendid physique seemed of that
kind which no abstract pain or trouble
could crush&mdash;who could ever bear himself
like a man&mdash;weak now as a little
child&mdash;levelled by the bullet of a cowardly
assassin.
</p>

<p>
Florian, though worn, weary, and sorely
athirst after the skirmish by the Euzangonyan
Hill, the subsequent pursuit, and all
connected therewith, before betaking him to his
tent, paid his next visit to Tattoo, for, after
his friend, he loved his horse.
</p>

<p>
A little way apart from where the
store-waggons were parked and the artillery and
other horses knee-haltered, Tattoo was lying
on a heap of dry brown mealie-stalks in a
pool of his own blood, notwithstanding that,
awaiting Florian's return and orders, a kindly
trooper of the Mounted Infantry had bound
an old scarlet tunic about the poor animal's
off thigh, where the bullet, meant for his
rider, had made a ghastly score-like wound,
in one part penetrating at least seven inches
deep; and where Tattoo had remained
standing for some time in one spot, the
blood had dripped into a great dark crimson
pool.
</p>

<p>
'Can nothing be done to stop it?' asked
Florian.
</p>

<p>
'Nothing, sir,' replied a Farrier-Sergeant
of the Royal Artillery.
</p>

<p>
'But the horse will die if this kind of
thing goes on.'
</p>

<p>
The sergeant shrugged his shoulders,
saluted, and turned away, while Florian put
an arm round the drooping head of the horse
caressingly; and, as if sensible of his
sympathy, the animal gazed at him with his
large, soft brown eyes, that were streaked
with blood-shot veins now.
</p>

<p>
'His vitals is safe, sir, anyhow,' said Tom
Tyrrell.
</p>

<p>
'I can't leave him thus in the cold&mdash;for
cold it is here, by Jove, at night; bring a
blanket from my tent, Tom, and put it over
him.'
</p>

<p>
After belting the blanket about Tattoo, by
the light of a stable-lantern, Florian lingered
for a time beside the poor nag, who hung
his head with unmistakable symptoms of
intense pain, while his drooping eyes grew
dull and heavy.
</p>

<p>
Without undressing, Florian threw himself
on his humble camp-bed, which consisted of
little else than a blanket and ground sheet,
but was unable to sleep more than ten
minutes or so at a stretch.  The fighting, the
hot pursuit by hill and stream and karoo&mdash;the
excitement of every kind, and the whole
work he had been doing&mdash;had fevered his
brain, and ever and anon he started from his
pillow as if a snake had been under it; and
so passed the few short hours till drum and
bugle announced the <i>reveille</i>, and that the
day-work of the camp had begun.
</p>

<p>
To those who saw him, he looked haggard
in the cold, grey, early light, as he quitted
his camp-bed, unrested and unrefreshed,
though mere repose of the body is supposed
to be a relief, and, as it was too early to
disturb Hammersley, he went straight to
visit Tattoo.
</p>

<p>
He was standing up now among the
mealies of his litter, with his head drooping
lower and his bright eyes more dim than
ever; but they actually seemed to dilate and
brighten at the sound of his master's voice.
The latter had brought him the half of his
ration-biscuit, soaked in water; and Tattoo
looked at it with dumb longing, and turned
it over in Florian's palm with his hot, soft,
velvet nose; but after trying to champ it
once or twice he let it fall to the ground.
Tattoo was incapable of swallowing now.
</p>

<p>
There was little time to do much, as the
troops were soon to march; but Tom Tyrrell
brought some hot water in a bucket, and
sluiced the wound with a sponge, and
redressed it with such rough bandages as could
be procured, and Florian got from Doctor
Gallipot some laudanum to mix with the
horse's drink to deaden the acuteness of the
pain he suffered; but it was all in vain;
Tattoo sank grovelling down upon his
fore-knees and rolled heavily over on his side,
and, as the wound welled forth again, he
turned his head and looked at his master,
and if ever eyes expressed a sense of
gratitude, those of the old troop-horse did so then.
</p>

<p>
'We march in a very short time, sir,' said
the senior officer commanding the Mounted
Infantry, as he reined in his charger for a
minute <i>en passant</i>; 'and in the cause of
humanity, as your horse cannot recover, it
had better be put out of pain.'
</p>

<p>
'Shot?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'Poor Tattoo!'
</p>

<p>
Florian turned away, sick at heart, as he
saw a soldier quietly dropping a cartridge
into the breech-block of his rifle in obedience
to the stern but necessary order, for if left
thus, the horse would be devoured while
living by the monstrous Kaffir vultures.
</p>

<p>
With carefully sighted rifle, and distance as
carefully judged, Florian had 'potted' many
a Zulu at various hundreds of yards, in
common with his comrades; he had shot,
as he supposed, Josh Jarrett without an atom
of compunction; but now, as he hurried away,
he put his fingers in his ears to shut out the
report of the rifle that announced the death
of Tattoo.
</p>

<p>
As a souvenir of the latter&mdash;for Dulcie,
perhaps&mdash;he desired Tom Tyrrell to cut off
one of the hoofs, and Tom polished the hoof
and burnished the iron shoe till the latter
shone like silver&mdash;the hoof that never again
would carry Florian across the wild karoo,
or to the front in the face of the enemy.
</p>

<p>
The Second Division now began its march
to encamp on the fatal hill of Isandhlwana&mdash;that
place of ill omen.
</p>

<p>
Hammersley was conveyed with other
wounded in an ambulance waggon, and it
was decided that if he recovered sufficiently
he should be sent home on sick leave to
Britain.  Florian occasionally rode by the
side of the waggon, the motion of which
was anything but easy or pleasant to those
who were in pain.
</p>

<p>
How pale, he thought, Hammersley looked,
with his delicate nostrils, clearly cut mouth,
and dark moustache; and his mind went from
thence to Finella Melfort, the girl he loved,
who was so far away, and whom he might not
be spared to see again.
</p>

<p>
'Write gently about all this affair to Miss
Carlyon,' said Hammersley feebly.  'But the
infernal telegrams will make poor little Finella
<i>an fait</i> of my danger before details can
reach her.'  Then he muttered to himself,
'How truly it has been said that the
indifferent are often tied to each other
irrevocably, while those who love truly are
parted far as east from west.'
</p>

<p>
'So you have fully avenged me, I hear?'
he said, after a pause, while his features were
contracted by pain.
</p>

<p>
'Of that there is no doubt,' replied Florian.
</p>

<p>
'For that I thank you, old fellow, though
I am low enough&mdash;in that state, in fact, in
which, we are told, we should forgive our
enemies, and pray for those who despitefully
use us.'
</p>

<p>
'These two rascals are past being forgiven
now.  I dare say long ere this their bodies
have been swept into the White Umvoloski,'
said Florian, who still felt somewhat savage
about the whole episode.
</p>

<p>
'Well, I am going to the rear at last, but I
hope we shall meet again.  If not,' he added,
with a palpable break in his voice, 'my
ring&mdash;take and keep it in remembrance of
me.'  And as he spoke Hammersley drew from
his finger a magnificent gipsy ring, in which
there was a large and valuable opal, and forced
it upon the acceptance of Florian.
</p>

<p>
'The opal is said to be a stone of ill-omen,'
said Hammersley with a faint smile, 'but it
never brought ill-fortune to me.'
</p>

<p>
Florian knew nothing of that, and, if he
had, would probably not have cared about it,
though reared in Devonshire, the land of the
pixies and underground dwarfs and fairies.
</p>

<p>
'The only reason for the stone being
thought unlucky,' said Hammersley, smiling,
'is that Mark Antony, Nadir Shah, and
Potemkin, wearers of great opals, all came to grief.'
</p>

<p>
'Going home, I hear, Hammersley,' lisped a
smart young <i>aide-de-camp</i>, cantering up to the
ambulance waggon.  'Egad, I envy you&mdash;you'll
see something better than Kaffir
damsels there!'
</p>

<p>
Hammersley, in the midst of his acute
pain, somewhat resented the other's jollity,
and said:
</p>

<p>
'The poor Kaffir damsels are content with
the handiwork of God, and don't paint their
faces red and white, as our English women
do in the Row and Regent Street, Villiers.'
</p>

<p>
'You'll soon be home&mdash;there is no such
thing as distance now,' rejoined the young
staff officer.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, Villiers, I am sorry to leave you all;
but I am going back to England&mdash;dear old
England&mdash;the land of fog, as Voltaire says,
with its one sauce and its three hundred and
sixty-five religions,' he added, with a feeble
smile, thinking he was perhaps rather sharp
in his tone to Villiers.
</p>

<p>
'And you have lost your favourite horse,
I hear?' said Hammersley to Florian.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, poor animal.'
</p>

<p>
'Then take mine.  I need not ask you to
be kind to him.  Who can say but you may
lend him to me one day for a run at Melton
again?  Now, good-bye, old fellow, God bless
you!'
</p>

<p>
They wrung each other's hands and parted,
Florian to ride on to the new camp at the
Isandhlwana Hill, prior to the march for
Ulundi, and Vivian Hammersley to go with
the rest of the wounded and sick to the coast
for conveyance to Plymouth.

<h3>
CHAPTER II.
<br /><br />
WHICH TREATS OF LOVE-LETTERS.
</h3>

<p>
The middle of July had come, and matters
remained almost unchanged in the family
circle at Craigengowan.  Lady Fettercairn
had not yet carried out her threat of getting
rid of Dulcie Carlyon, though a vague sense
of dislike of the latter was fast growing in
her mind.
</p>

<p>
Hammersley seemed to be effectually
removed from Finella's sphere, though by what
means Lady Fettercairn knew not; but still
Shafto made no progress with the heiress;
thus she feared some secret influence was
exerted over him by 'this Miss Carlyon,' and
would gladly have had old Mrs. Prim back
again.
</p>

<p>
It was July now, we say; and July in
London, though Byron says,
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'The English winter ending in July,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To recommence in August,'<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
to the lady's mind was associated only with
dinners, concerts, races, balls, the opera,
garden parties, and so forth, all of which she
was relinquishing for an apparently hopeless
purpose, while she knew that all her fashionable
friends would be having strange surmises
on the cause of this most unusual
rustication, and inquiring of each other,
'What are the Fettercairns about?'
</p>

<p>
Dulcie was painfully sensible that the lady
of the house had become cold, stiff, and most
exacting in manner to her, even condescending
to sneer at times, with a well-bred tone
and bearing that some high-born ladies can
assume when they wish to sting dependants
or equals alike.
</p>

<p>
Finella's other grandmother, my Lady
Drumshoddy, had ceased to be quite so
indignant at her repulsion to Shafto, as she had
a nephew&mdash;son of a sister&mdash;coming home on
leave from India; and she thought perhaps
the heiress might see her way to present
herself and her thousands to young Major
Ronald Garallan, of the Bengal Lancers, who
had the reputation of being a handsome
fellow and a regular 'lady-killer.'
</p>

<p>
Days and days and long weary weeks
passed by&mdash;weeks of longing&mdash;and no word
of hope, of love, or apology came to Finella
across the seas from distant Africa, evolved
as she hoped by the letter of Dulcie to
Florian, and her heart grew sick with hope
deferred, while more battles and skirmishes
were fought, and she knew not that a vessel
with the mail containing that missive which
Florian posted at the orderly-room tent had
been cast away in the Bight of Benin, and
that the bags had been saved with extreme
difficulty.
</p>

<p>
She contemplated Vivian Hammersley
facing danger in battle and sickness in camp,
marching and toiling in trackless regions, with
one belief ever in his angry heart that she had
been false to him&mdash;she who loved him more
truly and passionately every day.  So time
seemed to pass monotonously on, and her
unsatisfied longing to be justified grew almost
to fever heat; and death might take him
away before he knew of her innocence.  She
tried to be patient, though writhing under the
evil eyes of Shafto, the author of all this
mischief.
</p>

<p>
Could it be that Vivian had been driven
away from her for ever?  Daily she brooded
over the unhappy story of her apparent fault
and its bitter punishment, and she would seem
to murmur in her heart, 'Come back to me,
my darling.  Oh, how am I to live on thus
without you?'
</p>

<p>
And amid all this no sense of pride or
mortification came to support her.
</p>

<p>
By the two girls the Cape news was, of
course, closely and nervously watched.  The
tidings of Florian's promotion stirred the
hearts of both; but to anyone else in
Craigengowan it was, of course, a matter of
profound indifference, if remarked at all.
</p>

<p>
A telegram briefly announced, without
details, that Captain Hammersley had been
wounded after the skirmish at the
Euzangonyan Hill, but nothing more, as the papers were
filled by the death of the Prince Imperial;
so, in the absence of other information, the
heart of Finella was wrung to its core.
</p>

<p>
At last there came a morning when, in the
house postal-bag, among others at breakfast,
Shafto drew forth a letter for Dulcie.
</p>

<p>
'A letter for Miss Carlyon from the Cape,'
he exclaimed; 'what a lot of post-marks!
Have you a friend there?'
</p>

<p>
'One,' said Dulcie in a low voice; and,
with a sigh of joyous expectation, like a
throb in her bosom, she thrust it into her
bodice for perusal by-and-by, when no curious
or scrutinizing eyes were upon her, after she
had duly performed the most important duty
of the day, washing and combing Snap, the
pug; and the action was seen by Shafto,
who smiled one of his ugly smiles.
</p>

<p>
When, after a time, she was at leisure,
Finella drew near her, expectant of some
message.
</p>

<p>
'Come with me, quick,' said Dulcie; 'I
have a letter for you!'
</p>

<p>
'For me?'
</p>

<p>
'Enclosed in Florian's.'
</p>

<p>
Quick as their little feet could take them,
the girls hurried to a secluded part of the
shrubberies, where stood a tree known as
Queen Mary's Thorn.  Often when visiting
her nobles, the latter had been requested to
plant a tree, as if emblematical of prosperity,
or in order that its owners might tend and
preserve it in honour of their illustrious guest.
</p>

<p>
Such a tree had been planted there by
Queen Mary in the days of the old and
previous family, when on her way north to
Aberdeen in the eventful year 1562, when
she rode to Inverness on horseback.  Her
room is still pointed out in the house of
Craigengowan, and tradition yet tells in the
Howe of the Mearns that, unlike the beer-drinking
Elizabeth (who boxed her courtiers'
ears, and would have made Mrs. Grundy
grow pale when she swore like a trooper),
thanks to her exquisite training at the court of
Catharine de Medici, her grace and bearing
at table were different from those of her rival,
who helped herself from a platter without
fork or spoon, and tore the flesh from the
roast with her teeth, like a Soudanese of the
present day.
</p>

<p>
But, as Lord Fettercairn was greatly bored
by tourists and artists coming in quest of this
thorn-tree, under which the girls now seated
themselves, and he could not make money
out of it, at a shilling a head, like his Grace
of Athole for a glimpse of the Falls of Bruar,
he frequently threatened (as he cared about
as much for Queen Mary as he did for the
Queen of Sheba) to have it cut down, and
would have done so long since, but for the
intervention of old Mr. Kippilaw the
nationalist.
</p>

<p>
The delight of Dulcie on unfolding her
epistles was only equalled by the delight and
gratitude of Finella on receiving hers.
</p>

<p>
'Oh Dulcie, Dulcie!' ran the letter of
Florian (with the whole of which we do not
mean to afflict the reader), 'while
here&mdash;thousands of miles away from you&mdash;how often
my heart sickens with hungry longing for a
sight of your face&mdash;for the sound of your
voice, the sound I may never hear again;
for in war time we know not what an hour
may bring forth, or on each day if we shall
see to-morrow.  But, for all that, don't be
alarmed about me.  I have not the smallest
intention of departing this life prematurely,
if I can help it.  I'll turn up again, never fear,
darling&mdash;assegais, rifles, and so forth,
nevertheless.  The chances of our lives ever
coming together again seemed very small
when first we parted, yet somehow, dear
Dulcie, I am more hopeful now; and something
more may turn up when we least expect
it; and we never know what a day may
bring forth.'
</p>

<p>
Florian was far, far away from her, yet the
sight of his letter, perhaps the first he had
ever written to her, gave the lone Dulcie,
for a time, a blissful sense of love and
protection she had never felt since that fatal
morning when she found her father dead
'in harness'&mdash;dead at his desk.  Oh, that
she could but lay her head on Florian's
breast!
</p>

<p>
And as Finella read and re-read Hammersley's
letter a bright, sweet, happy smile curved
her lips&mdash;the lips that he had kissed in that
first time of supreme happiness, that now
seemed so long, long ago.
</p>

<p>
'I have been cruel, hard, suspicious,' wrote
Hammersley, 'till that fine young fellow,
then a sergeant of ours&mdash;the sergeant of my
squadron&mdash;a lad of birth and breeding
evidently, showed me the letter of Miss Carlyon&mdash;at
least that part of it which referred to us,
darling.  I did not know till then how bitterly
I had been deceived, and how we had both
been imposed upon.  Pardon me for the cruel
note I wrote you, and forgive me.  But,
Finella, as we have often said before, what
view will your people take of us&mdash;of me?  I
am not quite a poor man, though very much
so when compared with you.  Think if
monetary matters were reversed, and you
accepted a rich man who asked you to wed
him, would not people say it was his money
you wanted?'
</p>

<p>
'Fiddlesticks!' whispered Finella parenthetically;
'what matters it what people say, if
we love each other?  We marry to please
ourselves, Vivian, not them!'
</p>

<p>
'There are some arts that come by intuition
to some people,' continued Hammersley,
'and, by Jove! darling, that of soldiering
has come to your friend Miss Carlyon's
admirer.  His career will be a sure one; not
that I believe the marshal's baton is often
found in the knapsack of Tommy Atkins.
He was an enigma to me; his youth and all
that belonged thereto seemed dead and
buried&mdash;his past a secret, which he cared about
revealing to none; but such are the influences
of camp life and camaraderie that I drew to
him, and now I am as familiar with the name
of little Dulcie with the golden hair&mdash;golden,
is it not?&mdash;as yourself; so give her a kiss for
me.  I owe her much&mdash;I owe her the happiness
of my life in dispelling the dark cloud
that rose between us&mdash;in taking the load from
my heart that made me blind and desperate,
so that it is a marvel that I have not been
killed long ago.'
</p>

<p>
As she read on, to Finella it seemed that
it was all a dream that there ever had been
any bitterness between them at all; that his
fierce, short note, pencilled in haste and
delivered by the butler, had ever existed, or that
he had left her abruptly and hastily, without
a word or a glance of tenderness&mdash;not even
uttering her name, perhaps, the musical name
he was wont to linger over so lovingly; that
he had ever gone from her in a natural and
pardonable tempest of anger and jealousy.
</p>

<p>
And now how well and fondly she could
recall their first introduction in London,
though it seemed so long ago, when their
eyes first met with a sudden and subtle
understanding, 'and their glances seemed
to mingle as two gases meet and take fire,' as
a writer says quaintly; and though they had
spoken but little then, and well-bred
commonplaces only, each had felt that there were
looks and tones untranslatable, yet full of
sweet and hidden meaning to the sensitive.
</p>

<p>
For a time, as if loth to go back to the
work-a-day world, both girls sat under Queen
Mary's Thorn, each with letter in hand, lost
in a maze of happy dreams.  They could see
the shrubberies and the woods about the
mansion in all the glory of midsummer, the
smooth spaces of emerald greensward, the
balustraded terrace with its stately flights of
steps, and the pool below it, where the white
waterlilies and the white swans floated in
sunshine; but all was seen dreamily, and to
their ears like drowsy music came the hum
of the honey-bee and the twittering and
voices of the birds, while a beloved name
hovered on the soft lips of each, and seemed
to be reproduced in the songs of the linnet
and thrush.
</p>

<p>
'You will write to Captain Hammersley,
Finella,' said Dulcie, suddenly breaking the
silence; 'write to him and supplement all I
have written to Florian.  You see he is
too good, too brave, not to be completely
forgiving.'
</p>

<p>
'He has nothing to forgive,' said Finella,
with just a little soupçon of pride.
</p>

<p>
'Well, of course not; and his heart has
come back to you again, if it ever left you,
when he knows that you love him only, and
loved him always.'
</p>

<p>
'He sends you a kiss, Dulcie!' said
Finella, pressing her lips to the girl's soft
cheek.
</p>

<p>
'Be brave, Vivian,' urged Finella, when
she wrote her letter; 'I mean to be so, so far
as I am concerned, and do not be discouraged
by any opposition on the part of grandmamma.
I am rich enough to please myself.
Let us have perfect confidence in each other,
and we shall realize our dearest hopes, if
God spares you to me.  Oh, you dear, old,
passionate silly!&mdash;to run away in a furious
pet, as you did from Craigengowan, without
seeking a word of explanation.  How much
all this has cost me, Heaven alone knows;
but it is all over now.'
</p>

<p>
Her long and loving letter was
despatched&mdash;posted by her own hand.
</p>

<p>
'But his wound&mdash;his wound&mdash;when shall
I hear more of that?' was her ever-recurring
thought.
</p>

<p>
Now Shafto had seen the Cape letter ere
Dulcie had time to conceal it in her bosom,
and watching both girls, he had seen them
intent on their missives under the shade of
Queen Mary's Thorn.  So, knowing that
Dulcie's letter could only be from Florian,
intent on making mischief, he went to Lady
Fettercairn, whom he found in her luxurious
boudoir, and asked her if she 'approved of
her companion corresponding with private soldiers.'
</p>

<p>
'Certainly not,' replied the dame sharply;
'was her letter this morning from such?'
</p>

<p>
'I am certain of it.'
</p>

<p>
'This is excessively bad form!' she exclaimed,
reclining in a blue satin easy-chair,
with one slim white hand caressing the
smooth, round head of her goggle-eyed pug
dog.  'Send her here.'
</p>

<p>
'So you have a military correspondent,
Miss Carlyon, I understand?' said she, when
the culprit appeared.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, my Lady Fettercairn,' replied Dulcie,
colouring painfully.
</p>

<p>
'Is he a relation?'
</p>

<p>
'No; you saw, and&mdash;and were struck
with his likeness in my locket,' faltered poor
Dulcie.
</p>

<p>
'Well&mdash;I do not approve, while under my
roof, of your corresponding with private
soldiers, or sergeants, and so forth!'
</p>

<p>
'But my letter is from an officer of the
24th Regiment,' said Dulcie, with a little
pardonable pride.
</p>

<p>
'So much the worse perhaps&mdash;an officer?'
</p>

<p>
'Lieutenant Florian MacIan.'
</p>

<p>
'Indeed,' said Lady Fettercairn, languidly
fanning herself; 'I remember the name now&mdash;he
was so called after the girl MacIan,'
she added half to herself.  'MacIan! what a
name!  It is quite a calamity.  I do not care
to have you corresponding with these
people&mdash;while here,' she added vaguely.
</p>

<p>
Dulcie was on the point of reminding her
that the unfriended Florian was the
cousin-german of Shafto, but disdained to do so
when the latter so selfishly forgot that matter
herself, and bowing, withdrew in silence&mdash;too
happy to feel mortified.
</p>

<p>
When she and Finella went to bed that
night, though each knew every word of her
letter by heart&mdash;they slept with them under
their pillows&mdash;yea and for many a night&mdash;that
they might have them at hand to read
the first thing in the morning, so simply
sentimental had the proud Finella and the
fond little Dulcie become!
</p>

<p>
Dulcie's head was on her pillow, over
which her red-golden hair was tossed in
glorious confusion; but no eyes saw it, save
perhaps those of the man in the moon, the
silver light of which shone on the carpeted
floor, and then slowly stole upward in a
white line upon her white coverleted bed,
and ere long its soft and tender radiance fell
upon the equally soft and tender face of the
young girl, whose heavy dark lashes lay
close on her rounded cheeks, and whose
rosebud lips were parted and smiling, for she
had a happy dream, born of her letter&mdash;a
dream of Revelstoke and the old days there
with Florian, ere grief, sorrow, separation,
and the bitter realities of life came upon
them.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap03"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER III.
<br /><br />
IN THE HOWE OF THE MEARNS AGAIN.
</h3>

<p>
Dulcie was light of foot, young, bright, and
active, yet with all her lightness and activity,
times there were now when she failed to fly
fast enough for Madame's smelling-bottle, her
fan, her Shetland shawl, her footstool, or
down-pillow, especially when the latter had
her headache, or that <i>migraine</i> which could
only be cured in the atmosphere of Belgravia,
and made her at times also most irritable with
Finella.
</p>

<p>
Dulcie could play well and sing well too,
not being one of those who think that, so
long as the music of a song is heard, the
words are quite unnecessary; but Lady
Fettercairn 'snubbed' her attempts at either,
and openly hinted that it was as much out
of place for a 'companion,' however highly
accomplished or trained, to seat herself at a
piano in the drawing-room as to ride about
the country lanes with a daughter of the
house; but Dulcie, who was neither highly
accomplished nor trained, but self-taught
merely, so far as her music went, could
scarcely believe that Lady Fettercairn meant
steadily to mortify and humble her, till one
day, when she thought she was alone, and
was idling over the keys of the piano, singing
softly to herself a verse of a little old song,
that was a favourite of Florian's, and seemed
applicable to herself:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'I saw her not as others did,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her spirits free and wild;<br />
  I knew her heart was often sad<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When carelessly she smiled;<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Although amid a happy throng<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her laugh was often loud;<br />
  I knew her heart, her secret soul,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By secret grief was bowed,'&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
she stopped suddenly on finding the cold
and inquiring blue eyes of Lady Fettercairn
focusing her with her eyeglass.  Indeed, in
a somewhat undignified manner, Madame
seemed constantly on the watch for her now,
and was always appearing at unexpected
times and in unexpected places.
</p>

<p>
'Please to cease this English ballad, Miss
Carlyon; it sounds as if more suited to the
atmosphere of the servants' hall than my
drawing-room, I think.'
</p>

<p>
'I thought I was alone,' replied Dulcie,
colouring deeply at this sharp and wanton
rebuke; and with tremulous hands she softly
closed the piano and stole away, with difficulty
restraining her tears, and hastened to
her first morning work&mdash;the washing and
combing of Snap, the fat little ill-natured
pug, with an apoplectic-like neck, who was
furnished with a beautiful collar of silver and
blue enamel, and usually took his repose in a
mother-of-pearl basket, lined with blue satin,
in the boudoir; and Snap had a pedigree
longer than that of the Melforts of Fettercairn,
and, unlike theirs, was not tarnished by
political roguery.
</p>

<p>
Impulsive Dulcie had, as we have shown,
unintentionally wound herself round the
heart of the equally impulsive Finella, for she
had an honest English truthfulness about her
which, united to her naturally happy and
loving nature, made her generally irresistible;
and now the girls had a powerful secret tie
of their own between them, and to Finella
Dulcie carried her complaints of her treatment.
</p>

<p>
'No woman of heart&mdash;no lady would be
intentionally unkind to you, Dulcie,' urged
Finella.
</p>

<p>
'Not positively so; but she might by a
glance or a word remind me of utter
dependence for food and clothing in a way that
would be felt more keenly than an open
insult; and, truth to tell, Lady Fettercairn
speaks out plainly now.  And then,' added
Dulcie with perfect simplicity, 'a governess
or companion, if pretty, is so liable to be
snubbed.'
</p>

<p>
But the petty tyranny was continued from
time to time.
</p>

<p>
Dulcie feared the dog Snap, yet, as she
had been accustomed to have pets at home
in Revelstoke, she succeeded in teaching it a
few tricks, and rewarding the educational
efforts by biscuits and lumps of sugar.  Snap
ere long would sit erect on his hind legs with
a morsel balanced on the point of his
remarkably short black nose; and when she
said, 'Ready&mdash;present&mdash;fire,' and clapped
her little hands, he shot it upward and caught
it skilfully with a snap in descending.
</p>

<p>
With girlish glee she was showing this feat
to Finella, when Lady Fettercairn appeared
and said with a hard, metallic voice:
</p>

<p>
'Please not to teach my poor dog these
vulgar tricks, Miss Carlyon; these words of
command&mdash;did you learn them from your
friend the corporal, or sergeant, or what is he?'
</p>

<p>
'Grandmamma!' exclaimed Finella, in a
voice of astonishment and reproach, while
Dulcie's heart swelled and her eyes filled
with tears, and as usual she withdrew.
'How can you speak thus to her?' asked
Finella.
</p>

<p>
'I mean what I say,' was the cold response;
'moreover, as you seem in her confidence,
perhaps you will be good enough to tell her
that if I permit her in the drawing-room,
occasionally to make herself useful when a
little music or a hand at cards is wanted, she
must not wear low bodies or short sleeves on
any occasion,' added Lady Fettercairn, who
had detected the eyes of more than one male
guest wander appreciatively to the beautiful
arms of Dulcie, that shone like polished
alabaster, especially when contrasted with her
black mourning costume.
</p>

<p>
And when Lady Fettercairn took the
trouble to be ill, which was pretty frequently
now, as she was worried by being kept away
so long from London and London gaieties,
for no purpose or end, apparently, so far as
Finella and Shafto were concerned, she
established a headache as a domestic institution,
during the prevalence of which no one
was to address her on any subject whatever&mdash;more
than all, no one was to cross her.
But Shafto's extravagance and growing evil
habits were becoming a source of perpetual
thought to the Craigengowan household now.
</p>

<p>
If Dulcie had her troubles, so had also
Finella, for the family scheme 'anent' Shafto
was always cropping up from time to time.
Thus, when that young gentleman, who had
a very indifferent seat in his saddle, got a
terrible 'spill' one day, in leaping a hedge,
and was brought home in a very prostrate
condition, which his addiction to wine
considerably enhanced, the episode gave the
cold, selfish, and unpatriotic peer, who had
no great love for his newly found heir, some
cause for thought and consideration.
</p>

<p>
Failing heirs male, the Peerage of Fettercairn,
being a Scottish one, made before
the Union, would go to Finella in the
female line (as so many similar peerages do,
to the endless confusion of family names
and interests), and to the heirs male of her body.
</p>

<p>
It was a kind of consolation, but a sad one.
Whom might she marry?  'That fellow
Vincent Hammersley perhaps!'
</p>

<p>
'Finella,' said Lord Fettercairn, in his
hard, dry voice, and with the nearest attempt
at a caress that ever escaped him, 'if aught
was to happen to Shafto&mdash;which God forbid!&mdash;you
will be the heiress to the title and
estates.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, don't talk thus, grandpapa!' she exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
'You care for the old name, child!'
</p>

<p>
'I do indeed, grandpapa.'
</p>

<p>
'And would make a sacrifice for it, if necessary?'
</p>

<p>
'Believe me, I would!'
</p>

<p>
'To please me?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'You are a good girl, Finella.  I wish
then for you, apart from Shafto, who seems
going to the dogs,' he muttered bitterly, 'to
marry some worthy and suitable man, such
as I shall select for you,' he added
sententiously, and thinking, but not speaking,
of the home-coming Major Ronald Garallan.
</p>

<p>
'Indeed, grandpapa, I will do no such
thing,' said the wilful little beauty, firing up;
'I would rather select a husband for myself.'
</p>

<p>
'A day will come, girl,' said he, with an
air of undisguised annoyance, 'when you
will thank your grandmother and me, when
thinking of all this matter, so necessary for
consideration, when so much wealth and
rank are involved.  You are a good and a
bright little pet, Finella, and I would not
urge these matters on your consideration but
for your own good.'
</p>

<p>
Yet Finella only sighed wearily, and
thought of getting away from Craigengowan,
and viciously twisted up her laced
handkerchief with her nervous little hands.
</p>

<p>
But if Lord Fettercairn was beginning to
be hopeless of the affair of Shafto and
Finella, it was not so with the Lady of that
Ilk; she was still bent upon her matrimonial
plans, and as a part thereof she remonstrated
in a somewhat unfeeling way with the
innocent and unoffending Dulcie, who became
desperate in consequence.
</p>

<p>
Until now, when she became the object of
unworthy suspicions, she had been contentedly
enjoying the present, made all the
more pleasant to her by the friendship of
Finella, not troubling herself too much about
the future, nor indeed would the question of
that, if it meant ways and means, have been
very reassuring to her.  She could only
indulge in the visions of 'love's young dream,'
and no more, as yet.
</p>

<p>
'Your future is a serious consideration,'
said Shafto one day, with reference to the
subject, as he was airing his figure, with the
aid of a stick, on the terrace.
</p>

<p>
'What does it matter to you&mdash;what do
you care about it?' asked Dulcie impatiently.
</p>

<p>
'A man must always feel interested in the
future of a girl he loves, or has loved, even
though she has deliberately thrown him
over, and flouted him, as you have always
done me.'
</p>

<p>
'I never could nor can I care for you,
even as a friend; so simply cease this old
annoyance, please,' she said angrily.
</p>

<p>
'Beware, I say again,' said he, with knitted
brows.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, you have been manly enough to
threaten me before, but you are not yet
the master of Craigengowan, and may never be.'
</p>

<p>
This had only reference to his rash course
of life, and was but one of several random
speeches or shots made by Dulcie, which
always terrified and maddened Shafto, who
suspected that in some mysterious way she
knew more than he was aware of.  At
these times he could have strangled her,
and now he grew pale with momentary rage.
</p>

<p>
'I will no longer submit to your cruelty
and cowardice,' said Dulcie, her blue eyes
flashing as she felt desperate.
</p>

<p>
'What will you do&mdash;tell Lady Fettercairn?'
he sneered.
</p>

<p>
'No.'
</p>

<p>
'What then?'
</p>

<p>
'That is my business,' replied Dulcie, who,
truth to say, was beginning to meditate a
flight from Craigengowan&mdash;whither, she knew
not and cared not.
</p>

<p>
Shafto was again silent and alarmed.  With
all his brilliant surroundings, he never
knew what a day or night might bring
forth.
</p>

<p>
'After long experience of the world,' says
Junius, 'I affirm before God that I never
knew a rogue who was not unhappy.'
</p>

<p>
'We always want what we cannot have, I
suppose,' said Dulcie, after a pause.  'You
are like the fox and the grapes, Mr. Shafto,
in more ways than one; only the fox
displayed superior sense by retiring when he
found the coveted clusters beyond his reach,
in persuading himself that they were sour;
hence I would advise you to imitate the
proceedings of the fox.'
</p>

<p>
Shafto turned away and withdrew without
a word, as he beheld the almost noiseless
approach of Lady Fettercairn from a
conservatory door, with her cold, steel-blue eyes,
more steely than ever, her light-brown hair,
and firm aristocratic lips.
</p>

<p>
Like most fair women, she looked much
younger than her years, and, as we have
said in an opening chapter her really fine
face was without a line, as she had never had
a cross or care in the world, save the
alleged <i>mésalliance</i> of Lennard with Flora
MacIan, and that, in a general way, was all
forgotten now.
</p>

<p>
As she fixed her gaze on Dulcie, the
expression of her face was hostile and lowering.
</p>

<p>
While feeling certain that something
unpleasant was impending, Dulcie tried to
greet her with a smile, though 'the faculty
of looking pleased when one's heart is sick
unto death&mdash;of fulfilling with equanimity a
hundred petty social exactions, which one's
wearied soul loathes&mdash;is a talent verging on
the border-land of genius.'
</p>

<p>
'Miss Carlyon,' began Lady Fettercairn,
most freezingly, 'to my surprise I overheard
you giving some advice in a remarkable and
apparently very familiar way to my
grandson, Mr. Shafto Melfort?'
</p>

<p>
The remark was a question; but before
Dulcie, in her confusion, could form any
reply, Lady Fettercairn spoke again.
</p>

<p>
'I have remarked, and intensely disapprove
of these apparently secret meetings,
conferences, or confidences, which you will,
between persons in the very different relative
positions of my grandson, young Mr. Melfort,
and yourself, Miss Carlyon.  They are, to
say the least of them, very unseemly.'
</p>

<p>
'Lady Fettercairn!&mdash;&mdash;' began Dulcie,
almost passionately, and with crimsoned
cheeks.  But the dame, full of one idea
only, moved her head and resumed again,
and pretty pointedly too:
</p>

<p>
'You are no doubt perfectly aware, as you
have resided some months among us, that
my grandson is destined for his cousin, Miss
Melfort; and if her friend&mdash;as you say you
are&mdash;you are somewhat too much in his
society.'
</p>

<p>
'Can I help it?' said Dulcie, in the dependency
of her position compelled to temporize.
'I do not thrust mine on him&mdash;quite the
reverse, Lady Fettercairn.'
</p>

<p>
'Finella does not seem to affect her cousin,
I regret to say.'
</p>

<p>
'I think so too.'
</p>

<p>
'Thus, if she has mortified him, his heart
may be easily caught on the rebound.'
</p>

<p>
'By <i>me</i>?' asked Dulcie, in a straight-forward
manner.
</p>

<p>
'Yes,' replied Lady Fettercairn, sharply
and icily.
</p>

<p>
'My position in your house will never
permit me to dishonour myself.'
</p>

<p>
'Hoity-toity&mdash;dishonour!'
</p>

<p>
'A girl who would seek to ensnare a
man&mdash;as you hint&mdash;for wealth or position,
certainly does dishonour herself.  Death were
better than such a life as this!' murmured
Dulcie wearily.
</p>

<p>
'What do you mean by death, Miss Carlyon?
I overheard your remark; it is not fashionable
or good form to talk of such unpleasant
things, so please don't do it in future.  Besides,
at twenty, no one dies of grief or of
mock-sentiment, believe me.  A little time will
show me whether you are or are not the
real friend of Miss Melfort, and whether
you have not been, perhaps, too long here.'
</p>

<p>
'Too long, indeed, for my own peace,' said
Dulcie, in a broken voice.
</p>

<p>
'I am responsible for the consequences, if
he chooses to make a fool of himself with
you,' said Lady Fettercairn, mistaking the
meaning of Dulcie's speech.
</p>

<p>
'What do you mean, madam?' asked the
latter, as a desperate and hunted feeling came
over her.
</p>

<p>
'I am scarcely bound to explain myself,
but might act,' replied Lady Fettercairn,
astonished and almost discomfited by this
audacity on the part of a dependant, 'especially
so far as you are concerned.  If I mistake
not, I employed you, Miss Carlyon, to be my
useful companion, and not to act as a monitress
to my grandson, and to turn your gifts
of beauty or accomplishments to the use you
are doing.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, this is indeed torture!' exclaimed
Dulcie, as hot tears rushed to her eyes; and
as she thought of what her real relations were
with Shafto, and how she loathed him, she
exclaimed with genuine agony, 'how can
you&mdash;how dare you be so cruel?'
</p>

<p>
'Miss Carlyon, this tone to me?  You
forget yourself.'
</p>

<p>
'No, Lady Fettercairn,' retorted Dulcie,
with kindling cheeks and blue eyes sparkling
through their tears; 'too well do I know,
and have been made to feel, that I am a
dependant in Craigengowan; but I brought
into it a spirit as honest and independent as
if our places had been reversed&mdash;I the rich
lady and you my poor dependant.'
</p>

<p>
'If I wrong you I regret it,' said Lady
Fettercairn; 'so here, for a time, let this
unpleasant matter end.'
</p>

<p>
And, with a slight bow, she sailed away
into the conservatory.
</p>

<p>
But Dulcie felt that there the matter could
not and should not end, and she began to
think seriously of flying from Craigengowan.
</p>

<p>
With a little stifled cry that broke from her
quivering lips, Dulcie rushed down the steps
of the terrace and fled through the shrubberies
like a hunted animal, looking neither
to the right nor left, till she reached the
sequestered spot where stood Queen Mary's
Thorn, and, flinging herself face downwards
in the grass, she uttered again and again her
father's name, as if she would summon him
to her protection and aid, amid a flood of
passionate tears&mdash;tears from the depths of her
despair and intense humiliation.
</p>

<p>
Unmindful of the flight of time, or whether
she was wanted for attendance on Lady
Fettercairn or Snap, she lay there a whole
hour, while the shadows of tree and shrub
were lengthening round her.  She thought
her heart was breaking, so keen was her
sense of the affronts to which she had been
subjected; for, with all her sweet humility,
Dulcie was not without innate dignity and
pride; and in this mournful condition she
was found by Finella, who, suspecting from
her grandmother's bearing and aspect that
something was wrong, had kindly gone in
search of her.
</p>

<p>
She raised her up, caressed and kissed her,
and then heard her story with no small
indignation, though she knew not what to do
in the situation.
</p>

<p>
'I shall never, never forget you, Finella,'
sobbed Dulcie; 'but when I leave this I
know not what will become of me.'
</p>

<p>
'Leave this&mdash;why?'
</p>

<p>
'Would you have me stay after what I
have told you, and to be treated as I am by
Lady Fettercairn?  But now, to me, it seems
that the future of my life will be gloomy,
indeed, and full of torture and sorrow.'
</p>

<p>
'Don't talk thus, Dulcie; if ever a girl was
made for happiness and to give it to others it
is you, my plump little English pet!' said
Finella, taking Dulcie's tear-stained face
between her pretty hands, and kissing it on
both cheeks.
</p>

<p>
But Dulcie was determined to leave
Craigengowan&mdash;to go that same night, indeed.
</p>

<p>
'For where?' asked Finella.
</p>

<p>
'Anywhere&mdash;anywhere!'
</p>

<p>
'Impossible!'
</p>

<p>
And Finella, by gentleness and kindness,
soothed her over for a time, but a time only,
and during that period she was relieved of
the obnoxious presence of Shafto.
</p>

<p>
That personage found Craigengowan, when
there were no guests thereat, especially such
as he could lure into a game of <i>écarté</i>, or
pool and pyramid, 'deuced slow,' so he took
his departure for Edinburgh, where, as when
in London, he often assumed the uncommon
name of 'Smith' when involved, as he not
unfrequently was, in rows and scrapes which
he wished kept from the knowledge of Lord
Fettercairn, and which sometimes led to his
figuring before a presiding Bailie through the
medium of the night-police.

<h3>
CHAPTER IV.
<br /><br />
EN ROUTE TO ULUNDI.
</h3>

<p>
On the 19th of June the Second Division,
the operations of which were now combined
with those of Sir Evelyn Wood's Flying
Column, resumed its march to the front after
the failure of certain nude ambassadors from
Cetewayo to arrange with Lord Chelmsford,
who, on the 16th&mdash;three days before his
march began&mdash;had received the most mortifying
intelligence that he was to be superseded
in command of the South African Field
Force by 'the coming man,' Lieutenant-General
Sir Garnet Wolseley, ere whose
arrival took place, he hoped to end the war
by one vigorous blow delivered at Ulundi.
</p>

<p>
The troops were all in the highest spirits&mdash;full
of fine ardour, and longing to wipe out
the stain cast upon them by the miserable
fate of the Prince Imperial.
</p>

<p>
The first movement of the division was
the ascent of the great and steep Ibabanango
Mountain, and when that was accomplished,
Sir Evelyn encamped on the left bank of the
River Vemhlatuz, where open country
stretched on the left flank towards where
Fort Marshall was built, while the division
encamped in his rear on ground where dwarf
acacias grew, with tangled creepers, wild
vines, and cane-like plants.
</p>

<p>
Service and exposure had now made deep
the bronze of Florian's face and hands; but
the former had matured its expression, and
the fine manliness of it; a careless, not
precisely a rackety life&mdash;but a camp life, with
perils faced in the field&mdash;had made his features
and bearing less boyish than they were when
Dulcie bade him farewell at Revelstoke.
</p>

<p>
'A generous friendship no cold medium
knows,' says Pope; thus, when active operations
were resumed, Florian became painfully
conscious how much he missed Hammersley
at the head of the squadron, a charge that
had now devolved upon himself; for Vivian's
spirit of camaraderie and bonhomie, his manly,
gentlemanly, and soldierly bearing in every
way, with the little secret they had to share
between them, even as with Dulcie and
Finella at Craigengowan, formed an
additional link.
</p>

<p>
When would they meet again?  When
would they greet each other, if ever, more?
And while surmising thus he viewed with
genuine regard the valuable ring bestowed on
him by Hammersley, and patted with affection
the fine charger with which he had also gifted
him; but many more in the ranks of the old
24th missed Hammersley as well as Florian.
</p>

<p>
On the 20th occurred one of those skirmishes
with the Zulus which were of daily
occurrence.
</p>

<p>
Villiers, the young aide-de-camp, came with
orders for the Irregulars, Buller's Horse,
and Florian's little squadron of Mounted
Infantry to reconnoitre the ground between
two branches of the Umhlatoosi River, and
for this purpose they quitted the camp as
usual before dawn.
</p>

<p>
As they rode on in silence Florian's mind&mdash;for
he was apt to get lost in thought&mdash;was
dwelling on a legend he had heard, that the
Zulu people were the descendants of certain
shipwrecked seamen of a fleet which Pharaoh,
King of Egypt, had sent to the Southern
Sea, and that Zululand, some say Sofala, was
the ancient Ophir, where forests of cedar and
ebony grew, and gold, diamonds, and all
manner of precious stones existed in certain
geological strata.
</p>

<p>
As the Mounted Infantry rode on over
ground where troops had never ridden before,
herds of spiral-horned koodoos, of eland, of
hartebeest and the striped zebra went
scampering before them.
</p>

<p>
'What sport we might have here had we
not other work in hand!' exclaimed an officer
regretfully.
</p>

<p>
In two detachments they examined the
hills on the flanks of the way which was to
be the route of the division.  Buller's Horse
took those on the right; Florian's Infantry
those on the left.  The former soon unearthed
some Zulus, who fired a ragged volley and
then vanished over a steep crest, where it
was impossible to pursue them.
</p>

<p>
Skirmishes of this kind went on almost
hourly till the 26th, when Florian became
involved in what seemed a fatal catastrophe.
It had now become evident to the Zulus that
these continued advances of the Second
Division menaced the great Royal Kraal of
Ulundi.  Thus more and more of them were
visible daily.  Their opposition was growing,
and they made resolute attempts to burn up
all the tall feathery grass along the route; and
being dry as hay, it readily caught fire, to the
peril of ammunition in the pouches, boxes in
the gun-limbers and store-waggons.
</p>

<p>
On the 24th Sir Evelyn Wood's column
had reached a place called the Jackal Ridge,
and encamped on its summit, while the tents
of the division were pitched at its base in a
district where the valleys were full of
beautiful green bushes, where cotton trees and
castor-oil plants grew in the wildest luxuriance,
and the tall scarlet spikes and spear-like
leaves were varied by the green of the
spekboom and the <i>melkbosh</i> or spurge plants of
various kinds.
</p>

<p>
From the camp of the Flying Column on
the summit of the ridge a great kraal,
supposed to be Ulundi, was seen in the distance,
the kraal of which traders and native scouts
had circulated the most fabulous descriptions.
</p>

<p>
'Vague stories of the wealth of the king
went about,' says Captain Thomasson, adjutant
of Buller's Irregular Cavalry.  'Splendid
visions of loot in the shape of ivory, ostrich
feathers, and diamonds filled the soldiers'
eyes.  Incredible stories of the amount of
treasure taken at Isandhlwana were circulated.
It is needless to say these golden
visions were broken, not a man of the
regulars being a sovereign the better for any
loot taken.  Some of the irregulars got
small sums from deserted kraals.  The
amount taken altogether was small....
From here a good view of Ulundi can be
seen&mdash;the sight we have waited six long
months for.  The delight one felt must have
been similar to that which animated the ten
thousand at the first sight of the sea.  One
was almost tempted to shout Ulundi! Ulundi! as
they did Thalassa! Thalassa!  From the
same height we could see the sea in the far
distance.'
</p>

<p>
Prior to attacking some kraals that were
in front, on the 25th Sir Evelyn Wood's
column pushed forward again, and crossed a
stream by laying across it mattings of grass&mdash;a
process that occupied fully seven hours&mdash;after
which the Second Division followed.
</p>

<p>
Early on the morning of the 26th, the
day we have referred to, Lord Chelmsford
personally paraded a force to attack the
enemy.
</p>

<p>
It consisted of two squadrons of the 17th
Lancers, looking gay in their smart blue
tunics, faced and broadly lapelled with white,
their swallow-tailed banneroles fluttering out
upon the wind; Buller's picturesque-looking
Irregular Horse, Florian's Mounted Infantry,
Major Bengough's wild-looking natives, with
rifle, shield, and assegai, and two pieces of
cannon.
</p>

<p>
The kraals to be attacked stood in a
spacious valley, five miles distant from the
camp, and a stern resistance was expected.
</p>

<p>
At a canter the horse and artillery took
a circuitous route, and gained an eminence
overlooking the kraals, which were speedily
set on fire by shells, and, being of dry and
inflammable material, were at once sheeted
with red flame.
</p>

<p>
In each of these military kraals were two
thousand five hundred huts, and the dark
smoke from them ascended in separate
columns of stupendous height into the clear
and ambient African sky, and to avenge
their destruction a great column of some
thousands of Zulus, like a sombre, moving
sea, studded with grey and glittering
objects&mdash;bull-hide shields and assegai-blades&mdash;were
seen advancing swiftly along the green and
verdant valley.
</p>

<p>
'This will be no crutch-and-toothpick
business!' exclaimed Villiers, the joyous
young aide-de-camp, laughingly; 'here they
come,' he added, looking through his field-glasses,
'led by a tearing swell, with cranes'
pinions on his head, and no end of cows'
tails at his waist, and a shield like a door, by
Jove!'
</p>

<p>
The words had scarcely escaped him when
his horse was shot under him, and he 'came
a cropper,' as he phrased it, in doing so nearly
swallowing his cigar.
</p>

<p>
But the Royal Artillery 9-pounders opened
on them, plumping shell after shell into their
dense dark masses, so they paused, wavered,
faced about, and fled with the wildest
precipitation, pursued by the fiery and active
Redvers Buller, of the 60th Rifles (who had
served in the China campaign of 1860, and
with the Red River expedition under Sir
Garnet Wolseley), at the head of his Irregular
Horse, the Mounted Basutos, and Florian's
Mounted Infantry.
</p>

<p>
On they went, over the maimed and torn,
the dead and the dying, naked and bleeding.
Many were shot and cut down on every side,
and the casualties would have been more
terrible but for the awful state of the
atmosphere, which was steamy, hot, and
laden with the overpowering fragrance of
sheets of tropical flowers and plants that
clothed the two faces of the valley.
</p>

<p>
In the hot pursuit, as Florian was taking
his horse over a watercourse by a flying
leap, there occurred to him one of those
mishaps which, from one circumstance or
another, few horsemen have not experienced.
In mid-leap, the fiery animal was suddenly
scared by a huge black <i>aasvogel</i> (a kind of
vulture), that flew upward from among the
dwarf bushes with a vicious croak, and
caused it to swerve under him in the saddle,
giving his whole frame a painful wrench that,
without a wound or bruise, rendered him for
the time incapable of riding a yard further,
and with difficulty he dismounted.
</p>

<p>
What was to be done?  Advance with
the mounted men under Buller he could not,
neither could he return rearward to the camp,
now some eight miles distant, alone!
</p>

<p>
In a solitary hut of the nearest kraal&mdash;a
hut that had escaped the conflagration of the
rest&mdash;he was placed till the force could pick
him up on its return.  There Tom Tyrrell
placed a cloak over him, loaded his revolver,
and left him to continue the pursuit; while
his charger&mdash;the gift of Hammersley&mdash;was
meantime appropriated by Villiers, the staff
officer.
</p>

<p>
Perfect rest made the acute pain he was
enduring subside; but he still felt weak and
worn, and there he lay alone, amid utter
silence now, 'building castles in the air, with
conversations in the clouds'&mdash;conversations
with Dulcie, and castles for her to inhabit.
</p>

<p>
In the almost darkened hut, dome-shaped,
and roofed with thatch and enormous leaves,
and into which light came by the narrow
wattle-framed door alone, he lay thinking of
her, and the unpleasantness of her life at
Craigengowan, and marvelled much what
manner of place it was; for, till her letter
came, he had scarcely heard of it before, he felt
assured.  He thought, too, of the chances&mdash;the
problem of their meeting again&mdash;and that
problem stared him in the face in the light
like an unsolved question, or the game that
one goes to bed leaving unfinished; but with
him and with her it would be the most
important move in the game of their young and
at present, divided lives&mdash;the lives and loves
of two who were bound up in each other, all
the more that they had no one to care for in
this world save each other.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile one anxious hour followed
another, and there came no sound of troops
on the sward&mdash;no clatter of accoutrements to
announce that the pursuing Horse were
returning his way.
</p>

<p>
The Second Division and Wood's Flying
Column had marched to a mountain called
the Entonjaneni, and there formed a camp
about twenty miles distant from Ulundi as
the crow flies.  Vast quantities of thorn-bushes
grew on the left of it, and before it
spread an open plain; and to this camp came
nearly the last envoys of Cetewayo, bearing
two elephants' tusks as a sign of amity,
promising a herd of cattle, and so forth.  The
tusks were declined, and the original
conditions insisted on.  However, Lord Chelmsford
agreed to delay his final advance till the
evening of the 29th of June.
</p>

<p>
Buller's Horse and the other mounted men
were returning slowly from their long pursuit,
when they drew near the kraals so recently
destroyed, and saw that one hut was burning
still, and casting a lurid light against the
evening sky.  All thought this strange, as
before the repulse of the Zulus in the valley
the fire in every kraal was completely over,
as there seemed nothing more left to burn.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly Tom Tyrrell cried out, in a voice
of the keenest excitement:
</p>

<p>
'The hut in which we left our officer is in
flames&mdash;the poor fellow will be burned to death!'
</p>

<p>
'Who?' exclaimed Villiers.
</p>

<p>
'Our poor officer&mdash;Lieutenant MacIan.'
</p>

<p>
'God! you don't say so!'
</p>

<p>
'See for yourself, sir.'
</p>

<p>
'It is too evidently as you say.  Forward
at a gallop!'
</p>

<p>
The flames were sinking fast when they
reached the hut, now reduced to a smouldering
heap of ashes, and the horrible odour of
burned human flesh overpowered the perfume
of the wild flowers, amid which the great bees
were yet humming; and poking amid the hot
<i>débris</i> with their lances, the men of the 17th
found the charred remains of what had
been evidently a human body; and though
inured to war, to bloodshed, and daily human
suffering, the soldiers looked blankly and
inquiringly in each other's faces, pausing for
orders, and wondering what was to be done
now.
</p>

<p>
In the hut the luckless Florian had lain for
a time on its clay-beaten floor listening for
every sound.  He had a natural fear of
Zulus coming upon him suddenly and assegaiing
him in cold blood&mdash;if indeed the blood of
these fierce savages was ever cold till death
seized them.
</p>

<p>
The idea was intolerable; and he writhed
on the hard floor and hearkened intently with
his ear placed close thereto.
</p>

<p>
Shots in the far distance announced that
fighting was going on somewhere&mdash;that
Redvers Buller, the unwearied, was 'at it
again'&mdash;but told him nothing more.  What
if the advanced troops were defeated&mdash;had to
fall back towards the Entonjaneni Mountain
by some other route, and had to abandon
him to his fate?
</p>

<p>
In war, of what value is one human life,
save to the proprietor thereof?
</p>

<p>
Anon, amid these exciting and oppressive
thoughts, he became conscious of a singular
and awful odour pervading the place.  He
had knowledge enough of it by ample past
experience to know that it came from the
body of a dead Zulu.  He peered about, and
in a corner hitherto unnoticed, near a pile of
fresh bull-hides, intended doubtless for
conversion into long shields, partly covered by
one, lay the corpse of a Zulu warrior, whose
shaven head, with the military ring or fillet,
and bare feet, with anklets of burnished
copper, were visible.
</p>

<p>
Pah!
</p>

<p>
Such a companion as this proved too much
for his nerves, and at all risks&mdash;the risk of
being seen by scouting Zulus&mdash;he crawled out
of the hut into the pure and grateful air of
heaven, and contrived to reach a clump of
dwarf mimosa-trees at a little distance on the
slope of an eminence, and therein he lay to
await the return of his comrades.
</p>

<p>
He had with him his water-bottle and a
brandy-flask; and with the contents of these,
a sandwich or two (from his haversack) made
of tinned meat, and a ration of biscuit, he
made a meal, as mid-day was now past, and,
lighting a cigarette, strove to study the art of
being patient.
</p>

<p>
As he lay there and smoked, numbers of
insects, nameless to him&mdash;cicadas, huge
moths and butterflies&mdash;huge in the tropics&mdash;buzzed
and flitted about him; small birds,
the gold and emerald cuckoo, sunbird and
finch, with beautiful plumage, flitted from
branch to branch overhead; a lizard or
chameleon crawled along.  Dazed by the
heat, and under the influence of the latter,
and perhaps of his cigarette, Florian dropped
asleep.
</p>

<p>
From this he was startled by a trumpet
sounding the advance, and was roused just in
time to see the detachment consisting of the
two Lancer Squadrons, the Mounted Infantry,
Frontier Horse, and Bengough's Natives
resuming their route to the camp, after
investigating the ashes of the hut he had quitted,
and which had no doubt caught fire from the
hot embers of others blown against it by the
wind.
</p>

<p>
But Florian's heart sank within him at the
contemplation of what might have <i>been</i> had
he slept on&mdash;had the trumpet not been
sounded, and the troops had ridden away,
leaving him helpless in that solitude.

<h3>
CHAPTER V.
<br /><br />
THE LOADED DICE.
</h3>

<p>
Shafto was located in a quiet hotel in
St. Andrew Square, Edinburgh, whither he had
come in hope to raise money to meet the
difficulties in which he had become involved.
When away from the splendid thraldom of
Craigengowan&mdash;for thraldom he deemed it
now&mdash;he was daily and nightly in the habit
of imbibing more than he would have
ventured to do there; thus he was
becoming slow of speech, with the fishy eye
and the fevered breath of the habitual tippler,
even at his years, while in dress he adopted
a style that was a curious combination of the
dandy and the groom.
</p>

<p>
The many confiding tailors, jewellers,
horse-copers, wine-merchants, and others
whom he had honoured by his patronage
were now getting beyond all bounds with
their importunity and&mdash;as he thought&mdash;impertinent
desire to have their bills settled;
while, disgusted with him, Lord Fettercairn
had been heard more than once to say, even
to old Mr. Kippilaw:
</p>

<p>
'If Finella had been a boy I should not
have cared so much about there being no
other grandson of my own to ensure the
succession and carry on the title.'
</p>

<p>
But the peer did not yet know the worst.
</p>

<p>
Occasional visits to Edinburgh, and still
more those to London, were always involving
Shafto in one or other disgraceful scrape;
for, notwithstanding a most liberal allowance,
he was often at his wits' end for money, and
was over head and ears in gambling debts.
Thus he was a bitter pill to the patriotic peer,
his 'grandfather,' and he was on the verge,
he feared, of dire disgrace, as a whole lot of
post-obits might soon come to light&mdash;on the
fortune he reckoned would come to him on
Lord Fettercairn's death or his marriage with
Finella; for with two such prospects the
Jew money-lenders and other scoundrels who
trade as such, in Pall Mall and elsewhere,
under double names, had seen things in a
'rosy' light, and let him thus have 'no end
of money.'
</p>

<p>
And now, as a means of recruiting his
exchequer for a time, he bethought him of
young Kippilaw, who had been left £30,000
unexpectedly by an uncle in Glasgow, and
his first thought was to flatter and fleece the
fellow if he could, though the spruce little
W.S. was on the eve of his marriage with
one of the many daughters of Lord Macowkay,
the eminent senator of the College of
Justice; so he invited that gentleman to a
quiet little dinner at his hotel, 'Just to pick
a bone&mdash;sharp eight.'
</p>

<p>
Little Kippilaw, who was always flattered
by the society of a prospective peer, as
something to talk about in the Parliament
House, accepted with a radiant countenance;
and, as he had rather a showy-looking friend
who was passing through Edinburgh on his
way to Drumshoddy Lodge, he asked
permission to bring him.
</p>

<p>
'Certainly, of course,' said Shafto.
</p>

<p>
'Major Garallan is a client of the firm.'
</p>

<p>
'What! the old woman Drumshoddy's nephew?'
</p>

<p>
'The same.'
</p>

<p>
'All right; let us have him.'
</p>

<p>
So the Major came in due course.  He
was the beau-ideal of a cavalry man&mdash;tall,
handsome, well set up and put together,
dark-complexioned and regular-featured, with
his ears and neck scorched by the Indian sun
to a hue in which red and bistre were
blended; but an awkward accession he proved
to Shafto eventually.
</p>

<p>
The dinner, with its soup, fish, and many
entrées, was all that could be desired, from
the curaçoa to the coffee, and put Shafto's
two guests in excellent humour with
themselves and the world generally; the cloth
was drawn, the wine and dessert put on, and,
seated at the head of the table, Shafto almost
forgot his troubles, as he took bumper after
bumper of sparkling Pommery-greno, while
from the tall windows could be seen the
space of the stately square, with its tall
central column crowned by the colossal
statue, of Melville, and all its many-pillared and
palatial banks and public offices whitened by
the silver light of the summer moon.
</p>

<p>
The Zulu War was, of course, spoken of,
the mishaps at Isandhlwana and Intombe
discussed, though the subject was shirked by
Shafto, who cared nothing about it, save in
so far as the <i>danger</i> that then menaced
Florian; but little Kippilaw, who was a
full-blown captain in the Queen's Edinburgh
Rifle Brigade, talked a vast amount of
'shop' to the amused Major Garallan, whom
he ventured to instruct in the 'new method
of attack,' and thereby drew out the latter
insensibly to talk a little of his Indian
experiences, for he had served in the expedition
to Perak, against the Malays, and the Jowaki
expedition on the frontier of Peshawur, and
been wounded at the storming of Jummoo;
affairs that, though small in themselves, went
rather beyond a sham fight in the Queen's
Park, including the storming of St. Anthony's
Chapel and forming a rallying square in the
Hunter's Bog.
</p>

<p>
And now the conversation began to flag,
though Shafto had circulated the wine freely,
and he thought the time had come to propose
'a little mild play.'  One circumstance
surprised him&mdash;that though they were supposed
to be connected by marriage, the somewhat
haughty Major never made the slightest
reference to the subject.
</p>

<p>
'A quiet rubber of whist, with a dummy,'
suggested Kippilaw.
</p>

<p>
'With a dummy, no,' said Major Garallan.
'I like poker, but&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Poker be hanged!' interrupted Shafto.
</p>

<p>
At this abrupt speech the Major, a well-bred
man, pushed back his chair a little way,
while Shafto paused and felt in his waistcoat-pocket
a little white square ivory object&mdash;of
which more anon.
</p>

<p>
It was arranged that Shafto and Kippilaw
should have a mild game of <i>écarté</i>, while
Major Garallan smoked, idled, and looked on,
a course that the first-named gentleman by
no means approved of, as, for cogent reasons,
he had an intense dislike of having his play
overlooked.
</p>

<p>
Kippilaw, inflamed by the wine he had
taken inconsiderately&mdash;while Shafto, cautious
to a degree, had not, to use a phrase of his
own, 'a hair of his coat turned'&mdash;allowed
himself to be lured into doubling the stakes
again and again; and Shafto, who had his
own ultimate end in view, while playing to
all appearance with intense care, allowed
himself to lose eventually the sum of £500,
for which, as he had not the most remote
intention of paying it, he with great liberality
gave an 'IOU' to Kippilaw, who, not
being an habitual gamester, but by nature
and profession cautious and gentlemanly in
spirit, was rather scared in accepting the
document.
</p>

<p>
Then a pause ensued in the game, during
which more wine&mdash;Pommery-greno&mdash;was
circulated, fresh cards produced, and Shafto
invited the Major to play, but he declined
somewhat curtly, as Shafto thought.
</p>

<p>
He then urged Kippilaw to let him have
his 'revenge,' and the latter was willing
enough to let him have back the IOU if he
won it, or any portion thereof, as he disliked
to possess such a document signed by the
son of a client of the firm, and thought
secretly that he would not play a shilling
beyond that sum; but he had partaken of too
much champagne, which, when the Major's
back was turned, Shafto contrived to dash
with brandy, and soon the demon of play,
rivalry and acquisitiveness overruled the
reason of Kippilaw; but the nefarious action
of Shafto had not been unnoticed by the
Major, who had affected to be twirling his
moustache by the aid of a mirror above the
high black marble mantelpiece.
</p>

<p>
Shafto produced a dice-box; he lost, and
Kippilaw won, as it was intended he should,
and a silly laugh of exultation escaped him.
</p>

<p>
'Another IOU&mdash;you're in luck's way
to-night, Kippilaw!' exclaimed Shafto.
</p>

<p>
'How much have I won?'
</p>

<p>
'A hundred and fifty.'
</p>

<p>
The play went on&mdash;the dice-box rattled
again and again, while the Major, with his
back against the mantelpiece, looked silently
and curiously, but darkly on.  Shafto won
back&mdash;what he had lost as a lure&mdash;his £500,
with wonderful celerity, and then another sum
of £100, for which Kippilaw gave him a
cheque, signed by a very unsteady hand.
</p>

<p>
'Double or quits,' said Shafto, staking the
cheque, with his hand on the dice-box.
</p>

<p>
'Thanks&mdash;but I don't think I'll play any
more,' said Kippilaw.
</p>

<p>
'Oh&mdash;indeed&mdash;please yourself,' said Shafto
scornfully, while biting his lips with anger
and disappointment&mdash;'but after gaining
£500 from me&mdash;the devil&mdash;are you afraid?'
</p>

<p>
'No.'
</p>

<p>
'What then?'
</p>

<p>
'I have played enough&mdash;more deeply than
I ever did before.'
</p>

<p>
'Enough!' repeated Shafto contemptuously.
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'Too much, indeed,' said Major Garallan
suddenly; 'and, by Jove, you do right to stop,
Kippilaw.'
</p>

<p>
'What the devil do you mean?' asked
Shafto, becoming pale with sheer fury.
</p>

<p>
'What I say,' replied the officer coolly.
</p>

<p>
'Who the &mdash;&mdash; gave you a right to
interfere?' demanded Shafto in a bullying tone.
</p>

<p>
'I have watched your play, sir, for some
time past,' replied the Major quietly, 'and
know right well how and why the tide of
fortune turned so suddenly in your favour.'
</p>

<p>
An oath escaped Shafto, and snatching up
the cards, he hurled the pack to a remote
corner of the room.
</p>

<p>
'What does all this mean?' asked Kippilaw,
staring half tipsily and with a scared air at
the speakers.
</p>

<p>
'It means, you goose, that you have been
playing with a fellow who is no better than a
blackleg,' said the Major, with quiet scorn.
'No, <i>you don't</i>,'  he added, grasping, as if with
a smith's vice, the wrist of Shafto, who,
uttering a cry like a jackal, seized a cut-glass
decanter, with the fell intention of hurling it
at the speaker's head, but the latter cowed
him by one steady glance.
</p>

<p>
'You shall repent this insolence,' said
Shafto, starting to his feet.  'I will teach you
to question a man of honour with impunity.'
</p>

<p>
'Honour!' laughed Garallan.
</p>

<p>
'You shall hear from me, sir.'
</p>

<p>
'In what fashion&mdash;an action at law?'
</p>

<p>
'No; one perhaps you may shrink from.'
</p>

<p>
'Very probably.  You don't mean a duel?'
</p>

<p>
'I do.'
</p>

<p>
'Where?'
</p>

<p>
'On the sands at Boulogne.'
</p>

<p>
'Fool!  People don't fight duels nowadays,
and if they did, I am not required to
fight with a&mdash;swindler!  That is the word, so
let us hear no more high falutin.  A man of
honour, indeed!'
</p>

<p>
Garallan burst into a fit of scornful laughter,
and Shafto, mad with rage and disappointment,
was rushing to grasp the poker, when
the former, in a moment, and before the
apparently helpless Kippilaw could interfere,
if able to do so, in any way, had struck his
would-be opponent down, and wrenched from
his left hand, which he tore open by main
force, something that Shafto had attempted
to put in his mouth, and which, on
examination, proved to be&mdash;a loaded die.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap06"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VI.
<br /><br />
SHAFTO'S HORIZON BECOMES CLOUDY.
</h3>

<p>
The Major had gone to the 'little dinner' at
the desire of Kippilaw, but unwillingly; he
had evidently heard something about Shafto&mdash;knew
him by reputation, and during the
meal had treated him perhaps rather
cavalierly, which Shafto was too self-assertive
or too 'thick-skinned' to perceive, though
Kippilaw did.
</p>

<p>
The little W.S., who had never been in a
'scrimmage' since he left the High School,
was desperately scared by the whole affair, and
especially by the mauling given to Shafto, the
son of a client of the firm, the heir of Lord
Fettercairn, by the Major, who made very
light of the matter, and called him 'a d&mdash;&mdash;d
cad, and worse than a cad.'
</p>

<p>
When Shafto gathered himself up they
were gone, and he heard their footsteps
echoing in the now silent square (where the
tall column stood up snowy white in the light
of the waning moon) as they turned westward
along George Street, and a feeling
closely akin to that of murder gathered in his
heart as he poured the most horrible maledictions
on the Major, and drank a deep draught
of foaming Pommery-greno, well laced with
brandy.
</p>

<p>
That fellow had spoiled his game, and his
nefarious plans against young Kippilaw,
whom he regarded as a wealthy pigeon to
pluck.  No good ever came of a quiet third
party watching one's play.  He would be
even with the Major yet, he muttered, as he
ground his teeth; but how?  The Major had
carried off the loaded dice, and after splitting
it open, as doubtless he would, exposure
everywhere was sure to follow.
</p>

<p>
He was wrong in one supposition, however,
as the Major quitted Edinburgh next
morning for Drumshoddy Lodge, and, of
course, would be very unlikely to expose in
public one whom he deemed a connection of
his own.
</p>

<p>
Intending to attribute the whole affair of
the loaded dice&mdash;alleged to be loaded, he
would insist&mdash;to a tipsy brawl on the Major's
part, to a mistake or confusion, and carry it
off somehow, Shafto, driven to desperation
by want of money on one hand, even to
settle his hotel bill in St. Andrew Square,
and by some days of terrible doubt and
depression on the other, after writing a private
note to Mr. Kenneth Kippilaw about his
affairs, and fixing an hour for a visit
'thereanent,' ventured to present himself at that
gentleman's chambers, where a shock awaited
him.
</p>

<p>
As he passed through the hall, he saw
Madelon&mdash;Madelon Galbraith&mdash;seated in a
waiting-room.
</p>

<p>
'Madelon here&mdash;for what purpose?' thought
he, with growing anxiety, as he was ushered
into the presence of Mr. Kippilaw, who
received him with intense frigidity&mdash;even more
than frigidity&mdash;as he barely accorded him a
bow, and neither offered his hand nor rose
from his writing-table, but silently pointed to
a chair with his pen.
</p>

<p>
Despite this cold welcome, Shafto's
constitutional insolence of thought and bearing
came to him with a sense of the necessity for
action, for his grim reception by the usually
suave and pleasant old lawyer roused all his
wrath and spite to fever-heat.
</p>

<p>
'So&mdash;so, sir,' began the latter, 'so you, the
heir to the estates and title of Fettercairn,
actually tried to rob my simple son by means
of a loaded dice till exposed by Major
Garallan, to whom my warmest gratitude is
due; the split fragments are now in my
possession; but I presume it was not on that
matter you came to consult me.  And, not
content with such vile conduct, you sought
to taunt, bully, and inveigle the Major into
a duel, in which perhaps your superior skill
or cunning might achieve his murder.
Duels, however, are out of date; but penal
servitude is not, so beware, Mr. Shafto&mdash;beware,
I say&mdash;there is a rod in pickle for
you, I suspect.'
</p>

<p>
And as he spoke the keen, glittering eyes
of the old lawyer glared at Shafto above the
rims of his <i>pince-nez</i>.
</p>

<p>
'But you come to confer with me about
your private debts, Mr. Shafto,' he added,
lowering his tone.
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'You know the total amount, I presume?'
</p>

<p>
'Scarcely.'
</p>

<p>
'How so?'
</p>

<p>
'Well, when letters come to me I open
the white envelopes and chuck all the d&mdash;&mdash;d
blue ones into the fire uninspected.'
</p>

<p>
'A sensible proceeding&mdash;very!  How long
can it go on?'
</p>

<p>
'I don't know&mdash;perhaps you do,' was the
dogged reply.
</p>

<p>
As if it was useless to ask further questions,
Mr. Kippilaw looked over some papers which
Shafto had sent for his consideration, and his
countenance lowered and his white bushy
eyebrows became closely knitted as he did
so, while Shafto watched him with an aspect
of languid interest which he was far from
feeling, and sucked the ivory head of his
crutch-stick the while.
</p>

<p>
'Why, Mr. Shafto,' said Mr. Kippilaw,
'this is rank dishonesty.'
</p>

<p>
'What is?'
</p>

<p>
'This mess I am contemplating.'
</p>

<p>
'Don't talk thus to me; the greatest
robbers in the world, after one's own family
lawyers&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Sir!' interrupted Mr. Kippilaw, smiting
the table with his hand, and looking
dangerous.
</p>

<p>
'To business, then,' said Shafto sulkily.
</p>

<p>
'There's this bill of Reuben Levi, the
London money-lender, of which I have a
note, drawn originally for £500, at three
months, bearing interest at sixty per cent.,
and renewed three times!'
</p>

<p>
'Well?'
</p>

<p>
'The money value to the drawer is not
likely to be much at the close of the precious
transaction.'
</p>

<p>
'D&mdash;n, I think not.'
</p>

<p>
'Lord Fettercairn will have to take up these.'
</p>

<p>
'A few more too, I suspect,' groaned Shafto.
</p>

<p>
'This is quite as disgraceful as your affair
of the cards at that Club in Princes Street.'
</p>

<p>
'Which?'
</p>

<p>
'When you were found playing baccarat
with ever so many cards too much in the
pack.  I am sick of you and your affairs, as
you call them.  The man who can act as you
do, in these and other matters, is not likely
to discharge the duties that devolve on the
proprietor of Craigengowan and the title of
Fettercairn, alike teeming with temptations;
therefore I think his lordship will put it out
of your power to make ducks and drakes of
the inheritance, if he takes my advice.'
</p>

<p>
'<i>Your</i> advice!' thundered Shafto.
</p>

<p>
'Precisely so,' said Mr. Kippilaw quietly,
as he thrust all Shafto's papers into a drawer
and locked it.  'Lord Fettercairn has lost all
patience with you, sir.  People should not
incur debts they are unable to pay.  I know
of no action more mean or contemptible than
to make some man&mdash;a poor one, perhaps&mdash;lose
for another's amusements and enjoyments.
You ought to consider this.'
</p>

<p>
'Thank you, Mr. Kippilaw.  You are, I
believe, a leading elder in your kirk,
whatever that may mean; but I'll not have you
preach to me.'
</p>

<p>
'A man should do anything rather than
defraud his neighbour.'
</p>

<p>
'D&mdash;n you, you old cur! do you speak
of "defrauding" to me&mdash;you, a lawyer?' said
Shafto, grasping his cane.
</p>

<p>
'I do,' replied Mr. Kippilaw firmly.  Shafto
quailed under his gaze, and turned to leave
the room.  'Mr. Gyle!' said the lawyer, ere
he could do so.
</p>

<p>
Shafto turned and faced him.
</p>

<p>
'Ha!&mdash;you answer to your name, I see!'
</p>

<p>
'What do you mean?'
</p>

<p>
'Simply that I begin to think you are an
impostor!'
</p>

<p>
Shafto glared at him, white with rage and
dismay, while a minute's silence ensued.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps the astute lawyer had read that
remarkable essay by Lord Bacon on cunning,
wherein he tells us that an unexpected
question or assertion may startle a man and
lay him open.  'Like to him,' he continues,
'that having changed his name, and was
walking in St. Paul's, another came behind
him, and called him suddenly by his true
one, whereat straightways he looked back.'
</p>

<p>
'An impostor, dare you say?' exclaimed
Shafto, taking one pace to his front.
</p>

<p>
'Considering your conduct, I begin to
think so.'
</p>

<p>
Shafto felt for a moment or so relieved,
and said:
</p>

<p>
'What the devil do you mean?  You had
a properly attested certificate of my birth?'
</p>

<p>
'Attested&mdash;yes.'
</p>

<p>
'Was that not all-sufficient, even for your
legal mind?'
</p>

<p>
'Not&mdash;now.'
</p>

<p>
'Why not now?'
</p>

<p>
'Because I remember that it is mutilated.'
</p>

<p>
Shafto winced.
</p>

<p>
'It is there, however,' said Mr. Kippilaw,
pointing with his pen to a green charter box
labelled 'Fettercairn,' and Shafto thought
that if he did not adopt a high tone he might
fail in the matter.
</p>

<p>
'You scoundrel,' he exclaimed, as he
smashed his cane on the writing-table,
scattering letters and documents in every
direction; 'doubt of my identity is an insult
now!'
</p>

<p>
Mr. Kippilaw did not lose his temper; he
puckered up his eyebrows, actually smiled,
and looked cunningly at Shafto as he pulled
or twitched his nether lip with a finger and
thumb.  He was evidently reconsidering the
situation in his own mind, and coming to
the conclusion that there was a mistake
somewhere.
</p>

<p>
Shafto was sharp enough to read this at a
glance; he thought of Madelon, and his
heart became filled with black fury.
</p>

<p>
'I think our interview is ended,' said
Mr. Kippilaw quietly, as he dipped a pen in the
ink-bottle and laid his left hand on a bell.
'You will be good enough to leave my
chambers, sir, or I shall have you shown out
by the hall-porter.'
</p>

<p>
There was nothing left for him but to
withdraw, and as he did so, Madelon
Galbraith, who had been evidently waiting
an interview, entered Mr. Kippilaw's room,
and as she passed she gave Shafto a terrible
glance with her black, sparkling eyes&mdash;a
glance of hatred and triumph&mdash;as she had
not forgotten, but remembered with true
Highland bitterness, the day of her rough
expulsion from Craigengowan, when he had
actually hounded a dog upon her.
</p>

<p>
Shafto shivered; he felt as if an iron
network was closing round him, and that a
fierce legal light might yet be cast on his
secret villainy.
</p>

<p>
Guilt does not always look to the future.
It is as well perhaps, under any circumstances,
that we never can see that mystic
but certain period.
</p>

<p>
Smarting under Shafto's unbridled insolence
to himself, and acting very probably
on some information accorded to him by
Madelon Galbraith, whom he desired to
remain at his house in Edinburgh,
Mr. Kippilaw took means to achieve more&mdash;means
which he should have adopted immediately
after his first interview with Shafto.
</p>

<p>
Discomfited, there was nothing left for the
latter now but to cast himself on the mercy
of Lord and Lady Fettercairn in the matter
of his debts and involvements; and this,
after a few days of doubt, irresolution, and
much hard drinking, he resolved to do, and
so set out for Craigengowan.
</p>

<p>
In these few days the strands of Fate had
been twisting slowly but surely into a fatal
coil!

<h3>
CHAPTER VII.
<br /><br />
THE SQUARE AT ULUNDI.
</h3>

<p>
In the camp at the Entonjaneni Mountain
the troops had two entire days' rest, which
enabled Florian to recover completely from
the effects of the accident which had befallen
him in the pursuit of the Zulus.
</p>

<p>
In the afternoon of the 28th a telegram
came announcing to Lord Chelmsford that
Sir Garnet Wolseley had arrived, that he had
assumed the entire command, and requesting
a plan of the campaign, which, apparently,
Lord Chelmsford, having conducted thus far,
was resolved to finish for himself, as he
did.
</p>

<p>
With the same messengers came the mails
for the troops, and, to Florian's delight, there
came a letter from Dulcie&mdash;we say delight at
first, for that sentiment soon gave place to
one of anxiety.
</p>

<p>
At the sight of her handwriting, his heart
went back in a day-dream to the banks of the
Yealm and the Erme and to the exquisite
Devonshire lanes where they had been wont
to wander hand in hand together&mdash;lanes
bordered by banks of pale green ferns, while
the golden apples hung in clusters overhead.
</p>

<p>
Isolated now amid the different worlds in
which each lived, these two were tenderly
true to each other, at those years when they
who have been boy and girl lovers usually
forget, or form new attachments.
</p>

<p>
Florian was struck by a certain confusion
in the letter of Dulcie, which seemed to have
been written in haste and under the pressure
of some excitement, so that at times it was
almost incoherent.
</p>

<p>
'I am not superstitious, as you know,
dearest Florian, but I dislike the brilliant
month of June more than any month in the
year,' she wrote.  'Papa died in June, leaving
me alone in the world and so poor&mdash;hence I
have always strange forebodings of unseen
evils to come&mdash;evils that I may be powerless
to avert; thus June is ever associated in my
mind with sorrow, death, and mystery.  It
is then I have restless nights and broken
dreams of trouble haunting me&mdash;even of
hideous forms seen dimly, and I leave my
pillow in the morning more weary than when
I laid my head upon it at night.  It is June
again, and I am in trouble now.'
</p>

<p>
She proceeded then to describe her
persecution by Shafto, who was again returning
after an absence; that his presence, conjoined
to the taunts, suspicions, and tone of Lady
Fettercairn, made life at Craigengowan a
burden to her, and that she had determined
on flight from the house&mdash;from Scotland
indeed&mdash;but where she was to go, or what
she was to do, she knew not.  She had
resolved not even to consult her only friend
Finella, so that, by the time her letter reached
him, she would be out once again on the
bosom of the cold world!
</p>

<p>
So ended this distressing and partly
incoherent letter, which was the <i>last</i> Florian
received from Dulcie Carlyon, and by the
tenor of it there seemed a futility in sending
any reply to Craigengowan, as too probably
she must have left it some weeks ago.
</p>

<p>
'If killed to-day or to-morrow&mdash;anyway,
before Cetewayo is caught&mdash;I'll never know,
probably, <i>how</i> my darling gets over her
trouble,' thought Florian simply but sadly.
</p>

<p>
There came by the same post no letter for
the absent Hammersley, so Florian concluded
that Finella Melfort must have seen through
the medium of the public prints that he had
sailed for Europe on sick leave.
</p>

<p>
It was vain for him to imagine where and
amid what surroundings Dulcie was now,
and doubtless with very limited means; it
was a source of absolute agony to him at such
a time, when he was so helpless, so totally
unable to assist or advise her, and he seemed
as in a dream to see the camp, with its streets
of white tents and soldiers in thousands
loitering about, or stretched on the grass,
laughing, chatting, and smoking in the sunshine.
</p>

<p>
In the immediate foreground, on the branch
of a tree, hung the skinned carcase of an
eland, from which a powerfully built Hottentot
of the Natal Contingent, all nude save
a pair of breeches, was cutting large slices
with a huge knife, and dropping them into
Madras cowrie baskets prior to cooking them
in small coppers half full of mealies.
</p>

<p>
A rich plain stretched away to the north;
beyond it were mountains covered with grass
and dotted by clumps of trees, and in some
that grew close by the camp, numbers of
beautiful squirrels were hopping from branch
to branch in the sunshine.
</p>

<p>
Ulundi was now only sixteen miles distant
from our outposts, and from thence came the
last messengers of Cetewayo, bringing with
them as a peace-offering the sword of the
Prince Imperial&mdash;the sword worn by his
father, too probably at Sedan, with a secret
message&mdash;written by Cornelius Vign, the
Dutch trader&mdash;to Lord Chelmsford, telling
him that if he advanced on Ulundi to do
it with strength, as the forces of Cetewayo
were many, many thousands strong.
</p>

<p>
On the 1st July the division marched again.
</p>

<p>
Florian had been scouting with his squadron
all the preceding day and far into the night,
and lay in his tent weary and fagged on
a ground sheet only, without taking off either
accoutrements or regimentals.  There, though
worn, he had dreams, not of Dulcie, but
of his dead comrade, jovial Bob Edgehill,
and the little song the latter was wont to
sing came to his dreaming ears:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Merrily lads, so ho!<br />
  Some talk of a life at sea;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a life on the land,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With sword in hand,<br />
  Is the life, my lads, for me.'<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Then he started up as he heard trumpet
and drum announcing the 'turn out'&mdash;the
latter with the long and continued roll there
is no mistaking.  A hasty breakfast was
taken&mdash;scalding coffee drunk standing beside
the camp fires&mdash;the tents were struck, the
waggon teams were inspanned, the Mounted
Infantry went cantering to the front, and the
march was begun.
</p>

<p>
Beautiful though the district looked when
viewed from Entonjaneni, the country to be
traversed proved a rugged one, covered with
tall reed-like grass of giant height, that
swayed slowly in the wind, interspersed with
mimosa scrub and enormous cacti, with leaves
like sabre-blades; but by half-past one
a.m. the White Umvolosi was reached.
</p>

<p>
More scouting in a dark and moonless
night fell to the lot of Buller's Horse and
Florian's Mounted Infantry.  They could
hear the war-song of the vast Zulu army&mdash;unseen
in the darkness, but chiefly posted at
fords on the river, loading the still, dewy air,
rising and falling with wild, weird, and
impressive effect, now apparently near, now
distant; but so mighty ever and anon was
the volume of sound that it seemed to
corroborate the alarming message of Cornelius
Vign.  Among other sounds were the
awful shrieks of a dying prisoner, whom they
had impaled on the bank of the stream.
</p>

<p>
Much scouting, scampering about, and
skirmishing by 'bank, bush, and scaur'
followed for three days, and the 4th of July
saw the division on its way to fight the great
and final battle of the war, before Wolseley
could come on the ground&mdash;Ulundi.
</p>

<p>
The sun was well up in the sky, when the
column crossed the river at a point where
sweet-scented bushes, graceful acacias,
gigantic convolvuli, and wild guava fringed its
banks, where the bees were humming, and
the Kaffir vultures hovering over the slain of
a recent skirmish; and splendid was its aspect
in the brilliant morning light&mdash;the 17th
Lancers with their striking uniform and
'pennoned spears, a stately grove'&mdash;the
infantry, not clad in hideous 'mud-suits,' but
in their glorious scarlet, their polished
bayonets and barrels shining in the sun, while
in the hollows under the shadows of the
great mountains, shadows into which the
light of day had scarcely penetrated as yet,
the impis or columns of the Zulus were
gathering in their sombre and savage
thousands.
</p>

<p>
'The troops will form in hollow square!'
was now the General's order, and, with other
aides-de camp, Villiers, cigar in mouth, and
with flushed cheek and brightening eye,
went cantering along the marching column,
with the details of that formation for the
advance&mdash;the first instance of such a
movement in modern war, since William Wallace
of Elderslie, the uncrowned King of Scotland,
instituted such a system at the battle
of Falkirk, and consequently he, as Green
tells us in his 'History of the English People,'
was actually the first founder of 'that
unconquerable British Infantry,' before which
the chivalry of Europe went down.
</p>

<p>
As formed by Lord Chelmsford on that
eventful 4th of July, the infantry on the
four sides of his oblong square marched
in sections of fours, with all cavalry and other
mounted men scouring the front and flanks,
Shepstone's Basutos covering the rear, with
the cannon in the acute angles of three faces
of the square; all waggons and carts, with
stores and ammunition, in the centre.
</p>

<p>
This was about eight in the morning, and
with colours flying and bands playing merrily
in the sunshine, this huge human rectangle
marched in a north-easterly direction, past
two great empty kraals and a vast green
tumulus that marks the grave of King Panda,
the father of Cetewayo, who is seated therein,
buried in a partly upright position, according
to Zulu custom.
</p>

<p>
To the right of the marching square were
hills covered with thorn trees overlooking
the White Umvolosi; to its left were other
hills covered with enormous loose stones,
and in its rear was a rugged country tufted
with mimosa trees, and others that stood
up with feather-like foliage against the
blue-green sky.  And in the centre of a species
of a natural amphitheatre stood three military
kraals of vast extent, the principal being
named Ulundi.
</p>

<p>
At the extremity of this amphitheatre
there was visible a long line of oval-shaped
shields, above which black heads and bright
points appeared&mdash;the Zulu impis marching
forward in double column with a cloud of
skirmishers on their front and flanks, precisely
according to European tactics.
</p>

<p>
The square was halted now, the ranks
closed up, all facing outwards; the rifles and
cannon were loaded, the ammunition boxes
opened, and two of the kraals were set in
flames by the Irregular Horse; but one was
extinguished, lest the dense smoke from
it rolling across the plain might offer a cover
for the Zulu advance.
</p>

<p>
To lure them on, Florian was sent with
twenty Mounted Infantry, and, on seeing
so petty a force riding towards them, the
enemy wheeled back a portion of their front
as a trap.
</p>

<p>
'Come on, lads,' cried Florian, brandishing
his sword, 'come on!&mdash;though not a man
of us may return!' he thought.
</p>

<p>
But the twenty men only poured in a
rifle fire, wheeled about by fours, and,
galloping back, won the shelter of the square,
the four faces of which were fringed by steel
and garlanded with jets of fire and smoke,
while the roar of artillery shook the air, and
high overhead was heard the fierce rush of
the red rockets as they were shot into the
royal kraal of Ulundi and fired it in many
places.
</p>

<p>
With the rest of the mounted men, Florian
stood in the centre of the square, holding his
horse by the bridle and looking quietly about
him, and, like the rest, his heart beat high,
every pulse was quickened, and the excitement
became intense, as the long, long horns
of the Zulu army in its thousands closed
round the square, and as the circle contracted
and came within closer range it was a splendid
and thrilling but terrible sight to see the
masses mowed down like swathes of crass
beneath a mighty scythe.
</p>

<p>
The British troops were formed in ranks
four deep, two kneeling as if to receive
cavalry, the rifle-butt placed against the right
knee, and two erect, firing steadily, all with
bayonets fixed; and in this dense formation,
sad indeed would have been our casualties
had the Zulu fire been well delivered.
</p>

<p>
Closing upon their skirmishers rather than
permitting the latter to fall back upon their
lines, their attack embraced the four faces of
the vast hollow square, now shrouded with
white whirling smoke, and edged by glittering
fire and flashing steel.  Out of the dark
masses that were pouring on came bullets of
every calibre, from the sharp pinging cone of
the Martini-Henry to the heavy whirring
charge of the long elephant-gun, and many
a man and many a horse was wounded and
done to death thereby.  The old Zulu tactics
were pursued; the attack was ever augmented
by fresh bodies of infuriated savages, with
the same dire results to them; while all their
devotion and desperation could rarely carry
them past the verge of the cloud of smoke
enveloping the square; and thus, of the
thousands who came on, only hundreds
remained to waver or prolong the attack.
</p>

<p>
Whole crowds of naked and sombre forms
seemed to lie as if suddenly struck dead,
each man where he stood; and it was so.
Some, however, succeeded in flinging their
bare breasts upon the bayonet points, and,
with dying grasp on the rifle muzzles, went
down almost at the feet of the front rank
men, fierce, stern, fearless to the last, their
white teeth set, their eyeballs gleaming like
those of exasperated fiends, and their yells
rending the air.
</p>

<p>
'Steady, men, steady,' the officers were
heard to cry again and again; 'fire low&mdash;low,
and not so fast!'
</p>

<p>
Drury Lowe was unhorsed by a spent
bullet, but vaulted into his saddle again.
Eight companies of the Perthshire Light
Infantry, flanked by seven and nine pounder
guns in one face of the square, fought well
and valiantly, though young soldiers, and in
physique unlike those of whom Sir Francis
Head wrote when at Paris in 1815, when he
stated 'that a body of Scottish Highlanders,
or Lowlanders, standing shoulder to shoulder,
stretched over more ground than a similar
number of inhabitants, soldier or civilian, of
any other nation in Europe.'
</p>

<p>
The coolness of the men amid this close
strife, while the dead and dying fell about
them fast, was wonderful, the doctors
attending the latter; and in several instances
the former, ere they were cold, were buried
to save time, while the chaplain stood by to
read the burial service amid a tempest of
bullets.
</p>

<p>
'Have a cigar,' said an officer of the
Perthshire Light Infantry, seeing that Florian
was somewhat 'blown' after his scamper
from the front to the shelter of the now
environed square.
</p>

<p>
'Thanks,' said he, selecting one from the
speaker's silver case; but ere the latter could
give Florian a light, a ponderous knobkerie,
flung with superhuman force at random&mdash;the
last force, perhaps, of some dying
savage&mdash;smashed his head to pulp in his tropical
helmet as completely as a half-spent cannon
ball would have done, and covered Florian
with a sickening mess of blood and brains
together.
</p>

<p>
In imitation of the British formation, a
skilful Zulu Induna formed his men in a
hollow square and hurled them like a mighty
wave, with piercing war-cries and unearthly
yells, upon that angle of the great square
where six companies were posted under a
Crimean veteran of the Scots Fusiliers, with
two nine-pounder guns.  The fight here
became hand to hand, bayonet against
assegai, and many a shield, by main strength
of arm, was dashed against the breasts and
faces of our men; but speedily the Zulu
square was broken, rolled up, and the
survivors of it fled, stumbling as they ran
over their own fallen and the blood-soaked
ground on which the latter writhed and
weltered.
</p>

<p>
Under the sweeping fire of the Gatlings
they went down as forest leaves do before
the last blasts of autumn, and in thirty minutes
from the first opening of our infantry fire
they were falling back in disorganized masses,
which speedily, under the storm of shells,
took the form of one vast mob in wild and
helpless flight, while the cavalry were ordered
in pursuit, and with a loud cheer the 17th
unslung their lances, and by fours led the
way through an opening made for them in
the rear face of the square.  The Dragoon
Guards, Buller's Horse, and Florian's
Mounted Infantry followed in quick succession.
</p>

<p>
'Front, form troop!' was the first cavalry
order.
</p>

<p>
'Form squadron&mdash;form line&mdash;gallop&mdash;<i>charge!</i>'
rang out the trumpets, as, sweeping
round on their left pivots, the Horse took
the formations indicated, and then, with the
united force of some dread and terrible
engine, fell swooping down upon the foe,
hewing through the shrinking walls of brave
human flesh, after the lances were relegated
to the sling and swords were drawn.
</p>

<p>
It was a terrible sight to see how, on right
and left, these now red sword-blades were
plied, every man rising in his stirrups to give
deadlier impetus to his stroke, even when
the shrapnel shells, fired with time-fuses,
were exploding amid the foe.  From the
latter there came no cry for mercy nor for
quarter; they looked for none, as they would
have given none; and all who escaped the
slaughter of the pursuit did so by winning
the crests of some hills, where horses could
not follow them, and from which they opened
a lively fire of musketry.
</p>

<p>
Florian went on in this work like one in a
wild, bad dream; and it was only when the
halt was sounded, followed by the order,
'Fours about&mdash;retire,' that he became quite
aware of all he had escaped, had undergone
and done, and how mechanically he had
hewed about him&mdash;when he found the blade
of his sword, even his fingers, stained with
blood, and the sleeves of his tunic all ripped
and burst under the shoulders by the exertions
he had used.
</p>

<p>
Tom Tyrrell came out of the strife with
his helmet gone, his head bandaged by a
bloody handkerchief, and his horse's flanks
bleeding from three assegais that stuck in
them; but this was the case with several
others.
</p>

<p>
It is remarkable that after the battle of
Ulundi not <i>one</i> wounded Zulu was found on
the field.  Of all the hundreds upon hundreds
who lay there helpless, every man of them
had been despatched in cold blood by our
native allies.
</p>

<p>
The power of the nation had departed
from it now; and as for Cetewayo, he fled
from Ulundi the day <i>before</i> the battle; and
after the latter event his army began to melt
away, as the warriors returned to their distant
kraals, hopeless and sick of the war.
</p>

<p>
That named Ulundi was given to the
flames by the Irregulars and Mounted
Infantry, and its ten thousand dome-roofed
huts all blazing at once presented a striking
spectacle; and after that event the Second
Division and Flying Column began their rearward
march to the camp at the Entonjaneni
Mountain, to effect a junction with the First
Division under General Crealock.
</p>

<p>
To Florian, as to many others, after the
fever of battle had passed away, there came
the usual revulsion of spirit that follows
excitement so intense, and the keen thirst after
that excitement and exertion so great, with
the philosophical and not unnatural emotion
of wonder as to 'what it all had been about,
and to what end this terrible slaughter and
suffering!'
</p>

<p>
And he thought of the strange interments
of some of the dead in that hollow square
when under fire&mdash;young soldiers, instinct
with boyish, hopeful, and glorious life, ardour
and valour, struck down in death, and huddled
into a ghastly hole, over which the bullets
swept, ere their limbs were cold.  'Death is
a surprise&mdash;a woeful and terrible
surprise&mdash;whenever it comes, even though we be by
the bedside watching for it, dreading it, as
each breath leaves the lips we love.'  But
death seemed thus doubly grim on that day
at Ulundi!
</p>

<p>
The troops found their tents ready pitched
awaiting them at the camp beside the
mountain, and a welcome shelter they
proved, as the rearward march had been
performed under drenching torrents of rain.
</p>

<p>
Stormy and windy was the night of the
6th of July, the second after the battle, and,
for some days and nights subsequent the
falling rain rendered all operations impossible,
and added greatly to the sufferings of
the wounded, causing also a serious mortality
among the cavalry horses and commissariat
oxen.
</p>

<p>
Mail after mail came into camp as usual
bringing letters, some for the poor fellows
who lay under the sod at Ulundi, but there
were no more letters from Dulcie now for
Florian, and none from Hammersley, whom
he naturally supposed to be too ill to write
by a passing ship outward bound.
</p>

<p>
The letter he had received shortly before
the action at Ulundi was, as stated, the last
he ever had from Dulcie, and her sudden
and singular silence deepened his distress
and anxiety.
</p>

<p>
What had happened?  Was she ill, or
well?  How was she situated, and where?
These thoughts occurred to him in endless
iteration amid his military duties, which were
not dull routine, but, so far as the pursuit of
the fugitive King Cetewayo was concerned,
were arduous, full of excitement and perils of
various kinds.
</p>

<p>
His heart grew heavy, and his future, so
far as it was connected with Dulcie Carlyon,
seemed dark and uncertain, like the episodes
of a dream.  But it has been said that most
life-histories leave hanging threads that may
only be completed in the great web woven
by eternity, and eternity had often been
perilously close to Florian of late.
</p>

<p>
Dulcie was the only link he had in life&mdash;she
seemed to him as friend, sister, and
sweetheart, all in one.

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII.
<br /><br />
DISAPPEARANCE OF DULCIE.
</h3>

<p>
Since the reader last saw Dulcie Carlyon
she had become chilled and changed in
manner, under the influence of Lady
Fettercairn's bearing and remarks, to all save
Finella.  All her natural jollity and espièglerie
of way were gone, and every hour that it
was possible to do so she spent in the
seclusion of her own room, one high up in a
square turret of the old house, with windows
that opened to a far vista of the Howe of the
Mearns, terminated by a glimpse of the
German Sea.
</p>

<p>
Here she was sometimes joined by Finella,
who could no longer persuade her to ramble
as of old in the grounds, and never again to
accompany her in the saddle when she took
Fern for a spin along the country roads.
</p>

<p>
'Are you not sick of crewel work, and
embroidering sage birds of shapes that never
existed upon brown bath-towels?' asked
Finella.  'I know you do it by grandmamma's
wish; but what tasteless folly it is.'
</p>

<p>
'I would rather, as I did at home, knit
stockings for the poor,' said Dulcie.
</p>

<p>
'Better buy than knit them,' responded
the heiress, 'and so save one's self a world of
trouble.'
</p>

<p>
It became too evident to Dulcie that the
time of her dismissal from Craigengowan was
drawing nigh; that it was only delayed by the
absence of Shafto in Edinburgh, and she
resolved, ere he returned, to get the balance of
her little salary and quit the place, as it had
now become odious to her.
</p>

<p>
Dulcie had old Welsh blood in her veins,
and more than once had she heard her father,
Lewellen Carlyon, whose one ewe-lamb she
was, descant on how he could count kith and
kin into the remotest past, when his
forefathers wandered through the forest of
Caerlyon&mdash;whence his name&mdash;had manned Offa's
Dyke, and shared the perils of Owain
Glendwr.  To speak of such things now, even
to Finella, seemed to the girl vain folly,
but they were keenly in her heart nevertheless.
</p>

<p>
And so there came an evening, the last
she was to spend under the steep slate roof
of Craigengowan.
</p>

<p>
Lady Fettercairn was going for a drive
among the summer roads that were all like
leafy tunnels or long avenues of foliage, to
visit that famous senator, Lord Maccowkay,
who was then at his country house of
Middyn Grange, and Finella, perceiving how
pale Dulcie was looking, said:
</p>

<p>
'May Miss Carlyon come with us, grandmamma?'
</p>

<p>
'Certainly not,' replied Lady Fettercairn,
with hauteur and asperity, though Dulcie was
within hearing, carrying Snap in his satin-lined
basket.  'When is this sort of thing to
end, Finella?'
</p>

<p>
There came a time when the Lady of that
Ilk recalled this remark, and many others
similar, for just then she did not see certainly
where the future was to end.
</p>

<p>
So the two ladies drove away, and Dulcie,
for companionship, though then unaware that
it would be for the last time, took tea with
the kindly old housekeeper, whom she found
busy in her pantry and closets preparing for
that social meal; and Dulcie helped her to
cut and butter the bread, polish the cups and
saucers and old silver spoons, to arrange the
brown tea-cakes, crisp biscuits, and luscious
Scottish preserves of home manufacture, and
all the while a sadness oppressed her, for
which she could not account.
</p>

<p>
This, however, seemed explained when, at
dinner that evening, Lady Fettercairn said,
while returning a letter to her pocket:
</p>

<p>
'Shafto returns late to-night&mdash;or early
to-morrow morning.'
</p>

<p>
'From where?' asked Finella, though, sooth
to say, she cared little where from.
</p>

<p>
'Edinburgh.'
</p>

<p>
'And not an hour too soon, I am afraid,'
said Lord Fettercairn, with his sandy-grey
eyebrows deeply knitted.
</p>

<p>
No one asked 'why,' so a silence ensued,
and a little later in the evening Finella said
to Dulcie:
</p>

<p>
'Why are you so silent to-night?'
</p>

<p>
'Am I so?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;even sad&mdash;<i>triste</i>.'
</p>

<p>
'Sad&mdash;you don't mean cross?'
</p>

<p>
'No, Dulcie dear, you never are cross.'
</p>

<p>
'I am full of very weary thoughts, and wish
to retire, if Lady Fettercairn can spare me,'
she added, raising her voice.
</p>

<p>
'Of course&mdash;go,' replied the latter; and
Dulcie, painfully conscious that her employer
had been more than usually cold, hard, and
even bitter to her&mdash;all, no doubt, <i>apropos</i> of
Shafto's return&mdash;bowed and murmured
'good-night,' with a soft and lingering glance at
Finella.
</p>

<p>
Shafto returning!  Dulcie was always
nervous about his future conduct and her own
position, and she could not prepare herself
again for dissembling in public and hating in
private&mdash;for the inevitable meetings at table
and elsewhere.  Over and above all was the
dread that by his intense cunning he might
work her mischief&mdash;a mischief that to her
might prove social ruin.
</p>

<p>
Dulcie had writhed and winced under all
Lady Fettercairn's not always delicately veiled
hints as to the social gulf that separated
people and people&mdash;to wit, Miss Melfort, of
Craigengowan, and the paid companion, and
of young folks of bad taste and little
discretion, who were inclined to step out of
their proper sphere; she knew the drift of all
this; her heart swelled within her, and
now she withdrew with a stern and perhaps
rash resolve that took active form on the morrow.
</p>

<p>
In the corridor before they separated for
the night, Finella thought that Dulcie kissed
and clasped her with more than usual
tenderness and effusion, and became aware that
there were tears on the girl's cheek; but this
had been too often the case of late to excite
remark.
</p>

<p>
However, she remembered this emotion
with some pain at a future time.
</p>

<p>
In the morning the then small circle of
Craigengowan assembled in the charming
breakfast-room.  Shafto had not come
overnight; Lord Fettercairn had not opened his
letters, but&mdash;though nothing of a politician&mdash;was
idling over a paper which the butler had
cut and aired for him.
</p>

<p>
Lady Fettercairn glanced at a handsome
antique French clock upon the grey marble
mantelpiece, and said, with as much irritation
as she ever permitted herself to show with
reference to Dulcie:
</p>

<p>
'Not down yet&mdash;when she knows that
she has to preside at the tea-urn and so forth!
Is she giving herself the airs of a lady
of&mdash;what is the matter?' she exclaimed, as a
servant whom she had despatched on an errand
of inquiry returned looking somewhat
discomposed.  'I hope she is not ill, especially
with anything infectious?'
</p>

<p>
'No, my lady&mdash;not ill.'
</p>

<p>
'Not ill&mdash;that is fortunate.'
</p>

<p>
'No.'
</p>

<p>
'Where then is she&mdash;why not here?'
</p>

<p>
'She isn't there, my lady.'
</p>

<p>
'There&mdash;where?'
</p>

<p>
'In her room&mdash;nor anywhere in the house.'
</p>

<p>
Finella remembered the peculiar bearing
of Dulcie the previous night, and her tremulous
sisterly kiss, with a species of pang, and
hurried upstairs to the square turret-room.
</p>

<p>
'Of course she is interested!' said Lady
Fettercairn scoffingly.
</p>

<p>
'There is always an exuberant vitality&mdash;a
great flow of animal spirits about Finella,'
replied her husband.
</p>

<p>
'All of which I deem hoydenish and bad form.'
</p>

<p>
Finella returned, looking pale and scared,
to report that Miss Carlyon's bed did not
appear to have been slept in last night, that
her wardrobe was all tumbled about, leaving
evident traces of selections and packing, and
that to all appearance she was gone from the
house.
</p>

<p>
'Gone&mdash;then I hope it is not with Shafto!'
exclaimed Lady Fettercairn, paling at her own
idea.
</p>

<p>
'Scarcely: is he not coming here, as his
letter yesterday announces?' said Lord Fettercairn.
</p>

<p>
'Gone&mdash;and in that rude and
unceremonious, and certainly most mysterious
manner, which through local gossip will find
its way in some odious mode into every local
paper!' said Lady Fettercairn, while she
grimly directed Finella to officiate at the
tea-board.
</p>

<p>
'She is away, poor thing, without a doubt,'
said the butler, who was carving at the
sideboard; 'and must have left the house by the
conservatory door&mdash;I found it open this
morning.'
</p>

<p>
'I hope that she has not&mdash;&mdash;' but even
Lady Fettercairn, while surmising mentally
whether her jewel case was all intact, had
not the hardihood to put the cruel suspicion
in words.
</p>

<p>
'It is most annoying,' said the Peer, with
his noble mouth full.
</p>

<p>
'Very&mdash;she was so useful too&mdash;very&mdash;with
all her faults,' added Lady Fettercairn,
tenderly caressing Snap, who was relegated to a
housemaid for his morning bath.
</p>

<p>
She did not expect an escapade of this
sort; the great luxury of the certain dismissal
had been denied her; she sank back in her
chair for a minute or so, and sniffed languidly
at her gold-topped scent-bottle, as if nerving
herself to hear something horrible, while the
grounds were searched for traces of the
fugitive; and she had ideas of having the Swan's
Pool and the adjacent stream dragged.
</p>

<p>
Finella thought she would like to run away
too; but with all her wealth it was less easy
for an heiress of position to do so than for
the poor and nameless companion; and now
that Dulcie was gone, Finella felt that the
link between herself and Hammersley was
cut off.
</p>

<p>
Apart from that important item in her life,
she was deeply sorry, as she had conceived
for Dulcie one of those sudden and so-called
undying friendships for which, we are told,
'the female heart is specially remarkable.'
</p>

<p>
Finella felt that the cold and inquiring eyes
of Lady Fettercairn were upon her, and knew
that, if she would not excite remark and draw
reprehension upon herself, breakfast must be
partaken of, even though her heart was
breaking.  So she bathed her eyes,
re-smoothed her hair, and took her place at the
table with as much composure as she could
assume.
</p>

<p>
'If her flight is not traced&mdash;though why
we should care to trace it I don't know,' said
Lady Fettercairn bitterly, 'and if her body is
not found, we may conclude that she has
eloped with some low lover.  I hope all the
grooms, gardeners, gamekeepers, and so
forth, are to be seen in their places,' she
added; 'and with all her faults, in appearance
and style she was a great improvement upon
Mrs. Prim, with her iron-grey hair arranged
in corkscrew curls on each side of her face.'
</p>

<p>
Finella thought so too.  Lord Fettercairn
thought his better half had been latterly too
severe upon the poor little companion, but
did not venture to say so.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IX.
<br /><br />
FLIGHT.
</h3>

<p>
'Go I must,' murmured Dulcie, when in the
solitude of her own room she said her nightly
prayers on her knees.  'I cannot help it.  I
may come to want bread by the step I am
about to take, but better death than
enduring this system of mortification and
degradation.'
</p>

<p>
She had received her slender quarterly
allowance some time before that crisis, and
as yet luckily none of it had been spent.
How small a sum it looked to face the world
with!
</p>

<p>
She packed and prepared all her clothes,
intending to write to the housekeeper for
them when she found another home.  In an
ample Gladstone bag she placed carefully all
that was requisite for her immediate need,
and, weary with rapid exertion and heavy
thought, laid her head on the pillow of a
sofa, fearing to undress or trust herself in
bed, lest a deep sleep might fall upon her.
</p>

<p>
All was silent in the great house, and no
sound broke the stillness of the warm summer
night save when some dog bayed at the
moon from the quadrangle of the stable-yard.
</p>

<p>
Midnight struck on a great and sonorous
clock in an adjacent corridor; anon a little
French clock on her chimney-piece chimed
out two on its silver bell, but no sleep came
to Dulcie's eyes, nor did she desire to
court it.
</p>

<p>
Her mind was full of rambling fancies.
She thought of her parents lying so peacefully
side by side in old Revelstoke churchyard,
within sound of the sobbing sea, and of
what their emotions would have been could
they have foreseen all that was before her of
doubt and unhappiness; and with the memory
of them she tenderly turned over some
withered leaves that lay in a little
prayer-book Mr. Pentreath had given her, and
while doing so recalled the sweet lines that
seemed so <i>apropos</i> to them:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Only a bunch of withered leaves,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brought by a stranger's hand,<br />
  But they grew on a spot she dearly loved&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They bloomed in the dear old land.<br />
  Father and mother lie there at rest<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath the soft emerald sod,<br />
  Under the shelter of the cross,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And close to the house of God,'<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
close to the time-worn church of Revelstoke.
She thought of Shafto and the thorn he had
proved in her path, and felt a satisfaction
from the conviction that after this night too
probably she would never more look upon
his face.
</p>

<p>
She thought again and again of Florian.
Where was he then, and what doing?  Too
probably sleeping the sleep of the weary and
worn, on the bare earth in some tented field,
awaiting the coming perils of the morrow,
and then with the idea of Finella came fresh
tears for parting thus from the only friend
she had.
</p>

<p>
After three had struck she dressed herself
quickly in the costume in which she meant
to travel, assured herself that her purse was
safe, that her hat, gloves, and sunshade were
at hand, and sat down by a window to watch
for the earliest streak of dawn.
</p>

<p>
With all this earnestness of preparation
and of purpose she had no settled plan for
the future&mdash;no very defined one at least; her
sole desire was to anticipate the final
mortification of dismissal, and to get away from
the vicinity of Lady Fettercairn, of Shafto,
and of Craigengowan.
</p>

<p>
Save the Rev. Paul Pentreath, far away in
her native Devonshire, and the vicar in
London through whom he had befriended
her, she had no one to whom to look forward,
and, save for Florian's sake, she felt at times,
as if she cared little what became of her.
She would reach London, take a little
lodging there, and look about her for some
employment while her money lasted; and when
it was gone&mdash;gone, what then?
</p>

<p>
Again came the thought of Finella, whom
she loved with all the passionate earnestness
of an impulsive young heart thrust back
upon itself, and yearning for friendship and
affection.  Even with her regard it was
impossible that she could stay longer in the
same house with him who was now
returning&mdash;Shafto&mdash;even were dismissal not hanging
over her.  She could but go away; her
presence was necessary to no one's happiness,
and none would miss her&mdash;perhaps not even
Finella after a time, for the latter lived in a
world&mdash;the world of wealth and rank&mdash;a
sphere apart from that of poor Dulcie
Carlyon.
</p>

<p>
Amid these thoughts she started: dawn
was breaking in the east, but the world
around her was still involved in gloom and
sleep.
</p>

<p>
How long, long and chill, the night had
seemed; yet it was a short and warm one of
July, when there is only a total darkness of
four hours, especially in a region so far north
as the Howe of the Mearns.
</p>

<p>
Red light stole along the waters of the
distant German Sea; it began to tip the
hilltops and crept gradually down into the woods
and glens below, where the Bervie, the
Finella, and the Cowie brawled on their way
to the ocean.
</p>

<p>
As one in a dream, she sat for a little time
watching the dawn till the light of the
half-risen sun was streaming over the tree-tops
and through the parted curtains of her
windows, when she started up with all the
resolution she had taken overnight yet full
in her mind.
</p>

<p>
With rapid and trembling fingers she
assumed the last details of her travelling
costume, smoothed her golden hair, gave a
final glance at herself in the mirror, and saw
how pale and unslept she looked after her
past night's vigil, tied her veil tightly across
her face, fitted on her gloves with accuracy,
took her travelling bag, and with a prayer
on her lips prepared to go out into the
world&mdash;alone!
</p>

<p>
The clustering roses and clematis were
about the windows of the square turret-room,
notwithstanding its great height from the
ground; the birds were twittering among
them, and diamond dewdrops gemmed every
leaf.
</p>

<p>
Light and shadowy clouds of mist, exhaled
upwards by the early morning sun, hung
about the summit of Moelmannoch and other
hills, and in the sunshine the insect world
was all astir: the bees were already abroad,
and the blackbirds were hopping about the
gravelled terraces.  To Dulcie it seemed that
they at least were at home.
</p>

<p>
She leaned for a moment out of the window
and drank&mdash;for the last time&mdash;a deep draught
of the pure air that came from the lovely
Scottish landscape over which her eyes
wandered, as it stretched away down the
fertile and peaceful Howe of the Mearns, the
corn deepening into gold, the picturesque
houses, luxuriant orchards and gardens; and
she bade to each and all farewell, with little
regret, perhaps, for with all their beauty they
were too intimately associated with the idea
of Lady Fettercairn and many a humiliation.
</p>

<p>
Opening her room-door she stole swiftly
down the great carpeted staircase, passed
through the drawing-rooms into the conservatory,
the door of which she knew she could
unlock more easily than that of the great door
which opened to the <i>porte cochère</i>.  There was
no one yet astir in all that numerous household,
so, hurrying across the dewy lawn, she
turned her face resolutely towards the station,
where she knew she would reach the early
Aberdeen train for the South.
</p>

<p>
The country highway was deserted; she
met no one but a gamekeeper returning from
a night's watch, perhaps, with his gun under
his arm.  She thought he looked at her
curiously as she passed him, sorely weighted
by her travelling bag, but he did not address
her; and so without other adventures she
reached the little wayside station of Craigengowan
just as the gates were being unclosed,
and, quickly securing her ticket, retired to the
seclusion of the waiting-room.
</p>

<p>
Her heart had but one aching thought&mdash;the
parting with Finella.
</p>

<p>
In her pride and indignation we must admit
that Dulcie, ever a creature of impulse, was
not acting judiciously.  She had not stopped
to ask a letter of recommendation&mdash;'a
character,' she mentally and bitterly phrased
it&mdash;from Lady Fettercairn; neither had she
risked the opposition and kind advice of
Finella, but had thus left her present life of
irritation and humiliation to rush into a new
and unknown world, that now, even when
she had barely crossed the rubicon, was
beginning, as she sat in the lonely and empty
wayside station, to chill and dismay her.
</p>

<p>
'In the future that is before me, whom am
I to trust in again?  How am I to fight the
world's battle alone?' she was beginning to
think, even while the clanking train for the
South came sweeping across the echoing
Howe.
</p>

<p>
Ay, she so pure, so artless, so unsuspecting
of evil in others!
</p>

<p>
At last she was in the train and off.  She
gave one long farewell glance at the lofty
turrets of haunted Craigengowan, because
Finella was there, and felt that never again
would they ramble together by Queen Mary's
Thorn, the Swan's Pool, the old gate through
which the fated Lord rode forth to battle, or
by the old ruined Castle of Fettercairn with
all its legends.
</p>

<p>
Dulcie experienced a kind of relief in the
swiftness of the speed with which the express
train flew past station after station,
outstripping the wind apparently; villages and
thatched farms were seen and gone; trees,
bridges, ruined towers, those features so
common in the Scottish landscape, fields and
hedgerows, swept rearward, telegraph wires
seemed to sink and rise and twist themselves
in one, the poles apparently pursuing each
other in the fury of the pace.
</p>

<p>
Now it was Arbroath, where the train,
paused for a little time&mdash;Arbroath with its
mills, tall chimneys, and substantial houses,
amid which tower the remains of that noble
abbey which held the bones of William the
Lion, with its huge round window, for seven
hundred years a landmark from the sea;
anon came Droughty Craig with its ancient
tower, under the walls of which have been
shed the blood of English, French, and
Germans, with Dundee, 'the gift of God,'
amid the haze of its manufactories, to the
westward.
</p>

<p>
Here a kindly old railway guard&mdash;who
whilom as a 1st Royal Scot had shed his
blood at Alma and Inkermann&mdash;taking pity
on the pale and weary girl, brought her a
cup of warm tea from the buffet, and, as he
said, 'a weel-buttered bap, ye ken,' and most
acceptable they were.
</p>

<p>
A little time and her train was sweeping
through Fife, and she saw the woods of
Falkland&mdash;those lovely woods wherein 'the
bonnie Earl of Gowrie' flirted with Anne of
Denmark.  Soon Cupar was left behind, and
the Eden, flowing through its green and
fertile valley; and then, worn with the vigil
of the past night and her own heavy
thoughts, Dulcie fell asleep, without the
coveted satisfaction of a dream of Florian or
Finella.

<h3>
CHAPTER X.
<br /><br />
A STARTLING LETTER.
</h3>

<p>
The step taken by Dulcie was a source of
great mortification to Lady Fettercairn.
</p>

<p>
She regretted that she had not anticipated
such an unforeseen event by dismissal.
Visitors, she knew, would miss the bright-faced,
golden-haired English girl who&mdash;when
permitted&mdash;played with such good execution,
and sang so well and sweetly; and Lady
Fettercairn could not, with a clear conscience,
say that she had given her her <i>congé</i>,
or why.
</p>

<p>
'Miss Carlyon has put me in a most awkward
position,' she said querulously; 'her
conduct has been most unprincipled, in
leaving me thus abruptly, before I could
look about me for a substitute; and I think
Mr. Kippilaw might be instructed to
prosecute her criminally.  Don't you think so,
Fettercairn?'
</p>

<p>
But the Peer only smiled faintly and
applied himself to another egg.
</p>

<p>
Ere breakfast was over another event
occurred.  Shafto appeared suddenly at
table.  He had heard of Dulcie Carlyon's
absence or flight, and was in no way
surprised by the occurrence.
</p>

<p>
'You are just in time, Shafto dear,' said
Lady Fettercairn, with one of her made-up
smiles; 'tea or coffee?'
</p>

<p>
'Tea,' said he curtly, as Finella took the
silver teapot, Shafto all the while looking as
if he would rather have had a stiff and
well-iced glass of brandy and soda, for he had a
crushed and weary aspect.
</p>

<p>
'We thought you would be here last
night,' said Lady Fettercairn.
</p>

<p>
'Why?' asked Shafto, who seemed inclined
to deal in monosyllables.
</p>

<p>
'Your letter led us to expect you.'
</p>

<p>
'Did it?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'Well&mdash;I missed the last train.'
</p>

<p>
'You always do,' said Lord Fettercairn
somewhat pointedly.
</p>

<p>
'Ah,' thought Shafto, 'the old fellow's
liver is out of order, and gout threatening, of
course&mdash;a bad look-out for me.'
</p>

<p>
On that morning he did not like the
expression of Lord Fettercairn's face, so he
resolved to defer speaking of his 'affairs' till
a future time; but in a little space, as we shall
show, the chance was gone for throwing himself,
as he had thought to do, 'on the mercy'
of either Lord or Lady Fettercairn.
</p>

<p>
The evening before he had been among a
set of very different people&mdash;flashily dressed
roughs returning from a local racecourse,
their dirty hands over-bejewelled, with foul
pipes and fouler language in their mouths,
speeding hither and thither by train in search
of pigeons to pluck, with their jargon of
backing the favourite, making up books, and
playing shilling Nap and Poker by the dim
light of the carriage lamp, while imbibing
strong waters from flasks of all sorts and
sizes.
</p>

<p>
What a contrast they presented to his
present refined surroundings, with Finella
standing out among them, so pure, so
patrician, and so exquisitely lady-like; and
in attendance upon him, with hands that
were white as alabaster&mdash;Finella, fresh and
fragrant as a white moss rose, attired in a
most 'fetching' morning costume to the
feminine eye, suggestive of Regent Street.
</p>

<p>
Lord Fettercairn now addressed himself to
the task of opening his letters, after the
contents of the household postbag had been
distributed round the table by that rubicund
priest of Silenus, old Mr. Grapeston, the
butler.
</p>

<p>
There were several blue envelopes for
Shafto, which&mdash;with an unuttered malediction
on his lips&mdash;he thrust unopened into
the pocket of his tweed morning coat.
</p>

<p>
Among his letters Lord Fettercairn
received one which seemed to startle him so
much that, ignoring all the rest, he read it
again and again, his sandy grey eyebrows
becoming more and more knitted, and the
colour going and coming in his now withered
cheek, as Shafto, who was watching him very
closely, could plainly see.  He seemed
certainly very perturbed, and tossed aside all
his other letters, as if their contents could be
of no consequence compared with those of
this particular missive.
</p>

<p>
'Your letter seems to disturb you, grandfather,'
said Shafto.
</p>

<p>
'It does&mdash;it does, indeed.'
</p>

<p>
'Sorry to hear it: may I inquire what it is
about&mdash;or from whom it comes?'
</p>

<p>
'It is a letter from Mr. Kippilaw, senior,'
replied Lord Fettercairn, darting from under
his shaggy eyebrows, and over the rim of his
<i>pince-nez</i>, a glance at Shafto, so keen and
inquiring that the latter felt his heart stand
still; yet summoning his constitutional
insolence to his aid, he asked:
</p>

<p>
'And what is the old pump up to now?'
</p>

<p>
'Shafto!' exclaimed Lady Fettercairn,
who detested slang.
</p>

<p>
'He refers to something that may prove
very unpleasant,' said the Peer, carefully
smoothing out the letter.
</p>

<p>
'To&mdash;to me?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;and to me, I regret to say, most
certainly.  He says there are many matters
on which he wishes to confer with me
personally; among others, "A visit from an old
Highland woman, named Madelon Galbraith,
a native of Ross-shire, who was nurse to
Mr. Lennard's wife in her infancy, and also to
their son.  Her revelations, conjoined with
other things, now startle me, as they are
most strange, and must be probed to the
bottom."  He also says that this woman&mdash;Madelon
Galbraith&mdash;visited Craigengowan
in my absence.  Did such a visit take
place?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes,' said Lady Fettercairn.
</p>

<p>
'And she was expelled very roughly.'
</p>

<p>
'Well&mdash;I believe so&mdash;rather.'
</p>

<p>
'Why?'
</p>

<p>
'Because she was mad or intoxicated&mdash;most
insolent, at all events,' replied Shafto,
with a choking sensation in his throat.
</p>

<p>
'To you?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;to me.'
</p>

<p>
'Well,' resumed Lord Fettercairn, who
evidently seemed very much perturbed, 'she
has been with Mr. Kippilaw, as I tell you,
and has made some strange revelations
requiring immediate and close investigation.'
</p>

<p>
'May I know what they are?' asked
Shafto with a sinking heart, that only rose
when spite and hate and fury gathered
in it.
</p>

<p>
'No&mdash;you may not, yet,' replied Lord
Fettercairn, as he folded up the letter and
abruptly left the table; and that same
forenoon his lordship took an early train for
Edinburgh.
</p>

<p>
Shafto heard of this with growing alarm,
which all the brandy and soda of which he
partook freely in the smoking-room, and more
than one huge cabana, could not soothe.
Though fearing the worst, through Madelon
Galbraith, he thought that perhaps in the
meantime Kippilaw's business referred to his
gambling debts, his bills and promissory
notes, and too probably to his 'row with
that cad, Garallan,' as he mentally termed
the affair of the loaded die.
</p>

<p>
He rambled long alone in the same stately
avenue down which Lennard Melfort had
passed so many years before, when, with a
gallant heart full of anger, wounded pride,
and undeserved sorrow, he turned his back
for ever on lordly Craigengowan.
</p>

<p>
There he loitered, full of anxious and most
unenviable thoughts, sulkily dragging down
his fair moustache; and it has been remarked
by physiognomists that good-natured men
always twirl their moustaches upwards, whereas
a morose or suspicious man does just the
reverse.
</p>

<p>
From the avenue he wandered across the
lawn and under the trees, like a restless or
unquiet spirit, his unpleasant face wearing an
uneasy expression, and his eyes, which were
seldom raised from the ground, shifted always
from side to side.
</p>

<p>
'I may have to make a clean bolt for it,'
he muttered as Finella came suddenly upon
him, and, though detesting him, she was too
gentle not to feel some pity for his crushed
appearance.
</p>

<p>
'Shafto, why are you so disturbed?' she
asked.  'Of what are you afraid?'
</p>

<p>
'Of what?' he queried almost savagely.
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'I don't know.'
</p>

<p>
'Who then can know?'
</p>

<p>
'I tell you I don't know what to fear, but
things are looking infernally dark for me.  I
am going down the hill at a devil of a pace,
and with no skid on.'
</p>

<p>
'I do not understand your phraseology,'
said Finella coldly.
</p>

<p>
'Understand, then, that many of my
troubles lie at your door,' said Shafto,
turning abruptly from her, as he thus referred to
her aversion to himself and certainly not
unnatural preference for Vivian Hammersley,
and that much of the money he had raised
had been advanced on the chances of his
lucrative marriage with her.
</p>

<p>
'What is about to happen?  When will
old Fettercairn return, and in what mood?
What the devil is up&mdash;perhaps by this time?'
thought Shafto, as he resumed his solitary
promenade.  'I would rather face a hundred
perils in the light of day, than have one,
with a nameless dread, overhanging me in
the dark.'
</p>

<p>
And as he muttered and thought of
Madelon Galbraith, his shifty eyes gleamed
with that savage expression which comes
with a thirst for blood.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Lord Fettercairn, a man of
strict honour in his own way, though utterly
destitute of proper patriotism or love of
country, was being swept on to Edinburgh
by an express train; he was full of
bitter thoughts, vexation, pain, even grief
and shame, for all that Shafto was evidently
bringing upon his house and home.
</p>

<p>
He had secured, he thought, an heir to
his ill-gotten title and estates, and with that
knowledge would ever have to drain the
bitter cup of disappointment to the dregs.
</p>

<p>
Finella never doubted that, owing to
their great mutual regard, Dulcie would
write to her, and tell of her own welfare,
safety, and prospects; but weary, long, and
solitary days passed on and became weeks,
and Dulcie never did so.  She had perhaps
nothing pleasant to relate of herself, and thus
the tenor or spirit of her letters to a friend so
rich might be liable to misconstruction.  If
written, perhaps they were intercepted.  So,
regarding Shafto and Lady Fettercairn as
the mutual cause of the poor girl's flight, and
perhaps destruction, Finella now resolved to
leave Craigengowan, and go on a visit to her
maternal grandmother, Lady Drumshoddy,
then in London, when that matron, having
now her favourite nephew with her, began to
mature some schemes of her own; but
carefully, as she had read that 'the number of
marriages that come to nothing annually
because one or other or both of the innocent
victims suddenly discover they are being
thrown together with <i>intention</i>, is
inconceivable.'
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XI.
<br /><br />
THE PURSUIT OF CETEWAYO.
</h3>

<p>
Mail after mail came to head-quarters, brought
by post-carts and orderlies, from the rear,
but they brought no letters from Dulcie
Carlyon.  So, whether she had, as she
threatened she would do, fled from Craigengowan,
or remained there, found friends elsewhere
with happiness or grief, Florian could
not know, and the doubt was a source of
torment to him.
</p>

<p>
Horseback has been considered a famous
place for reflection, but one could scarcely
find it so when serving as a Mounted
Infantry-man, scouting on the outlook for
lurking Zulus, with every energy of ear and
eye watching donga, boulder, bush, and tuft
of reedy grass.
</p>

<p>
Sir Garnet Wolseley's orders to the army
reached the camp of Lord Chelmsford at
Entonjaneni on the 8th July, and the latter
prepared at once to resign his command and
return home.
</p>

<p>
Two days afterwards, that retrograde
movement which so puzzled and elated the
Zulus began, and after four days' marching
the Second Division and the Flying Column
reached Fort Marshall, on the Upoko River,
whence a long train of sick and wounded
were sent to the village of Ladysmith, in
Kannaland, escorted by two companies of
the Scots Fusiliers and Major Bengough's
Natives, attired in all their fighting
bravery&mdash;cowtails, copper anklets and armlets,
necklaces of monkeys' teeth, and plumes of
feathers.
</p>

<p>
'Great changes are on the <i>tapis</i>,' said
Villiers, as he lay on the grass in Florian's
tent, smoking, and sharing with him some
hard biscuits with 'square-face' and water.
'The 17th Lancers start for India;
Newdigate's column is to be broken up, and
chiefly to garrison that chain of forts which
Chelmsford has so skilfully constructed along
the whole Zulu frontier from the Blood River
to the Indian Ocean; but Cetewayo is yet to
be captured.  Sir Evelyn Wood and the
heroic Buller are going home, and so is your
humble servant.'
</p>

<p>
'You&mdash;why?' asked Florian.
</p>

<p>
'Sir Garnet has brought out his entire
staff, and I have not the good luck to be one
of the Wolseley <i>ring</i>,' replied Villiers, with
a haughty smile, as he twirled up his moustache
and applied himself for consolation to
the 'square-face.'
</p>

<p>
When, on an evening in July, Sir Garnet,
with his new staff, amid a storm of wind and
rain, rode into the camp of the First Division
under General Crealock, the appearance of
his party, with their smoothly shaven chins,
brilliant new uniforms, and spotless white
helmets, formed a strong contrast to the war
and weather worn soldiers of Crealock, in
their patched and stained attire, with their
unkempt beards; for the use of the razor had
long been eschewed in South Africa, where,
however, the officers and men of each column
trimmed their hirsute appendages after the
fashion adopted by their leaders; thus, as
General Newdigate affected the style of
Henry VIII., so did his troops; Sir Evelyn
Wood trimmed his beard in a peak, pointed
like Philip II. of Spain, and so, we are told,
did all the Flying Column.
</p>

<p>
Sir Garnet Wolseley now arranged his
future plans for the final conquest of Zululand,
and stationed troops to hold certain
lines and rivers, while the rest were formed
in two great columns, under Colonels Clarke
of the 57th and Baker Russell of the 13th
Hussars, two officers of experience, the
former having served in Central India and
the Maori War, and the latter in the war of
the Mutiny, when he covered himself with
honours at Kurnaul and elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
With Clarke's column were five companies
of Mounted Infantry, led by Major Barrow,
and one of them was led by Florian, who had
now earned a high reputation as an active
scouting officer.
</p>

<p>
Clarke's orders were to march northwards
and occupy Ulundi, or all that was left of it.
</p>

<p>
Without the capture of the now luckless
Cetewayo, the permanent settlement of the
country was deemed impossible; thus a kind
of circle was formed round the district in
which he was known to be lurking, to
preclude his escape.
</p>

<p>
The traitor Uhamu, with his followers,
occupied a district near the Black Umvolosi;
the savage Swazis in thousands under
Captain M'Leod held the bank of the Pongola
River, armed with heavy lances and
knobkeries; Russell advanced on a third quarter,
and Clarke on a fourth; thus the sure
capture of the fugitive King was deemed only a
matter of time.
</p>

<p>
At a steep rocky hill overhanging the
Idongo River the column of the latter, which
included three battalions of infantry, was
reinforced by five companies of the 80th (or
Staffordshire Volunteers), the Natal Pioneers,
and two Gatling guns, to which were added
two nine-pounders on reaching once more
the Entonjaneni Mountain.
</p>

<p>
It was now reported that Cetewayo had
found shelter in a little kraal in the recesses
of the Ngome forest, a dense primeval
wilderness of giant wood and deep jungle.  But
the meshes of the net were closing fast
around him.
</p>

<p>
Leaving the main body of his column at a
redoubt named Fort George, at the head of
only three hundred and forty mounted
infantry Colonel Russell, at daybreak on the
13th of August, rode westward beyond the
Black Umvolosi, into a district occupied by
many Zulus, in the hope of picking up the
royal fugitive.
</p>

<p>
The scouting advanced guard he entrusted
to Florian, whose men rode forward in loose
and open formation, with loaded rifles unslung.
</p>

<p>
The country through which they proceeded
was very wild, steep, woody, and rugged, and
on seeing how slender his force appeared to
be, the Zulus began to gather in numbers,
preparatory to disputing his further advance.
</p>

<p>
'My intention,' said Baker Russell, 'is to
reach Umkondo, where Cetewayo is said to
be lurking; you will therefore show a bold
front and clear the way at all hazards.'
</p>

<p>
This left Florian no alternative but to fight
his opponents, whatever their strength
perhaps, and the region into which they were
now penetrating had the new and most
unusual danger of being infested by lions, as
the 1st King's Dragoon Guards found to
their cost.
</p>

<p>
Manning a narrow gorge fringed with
thornwood trees and date palms, with brandished
rifle and assegai and their grey shields
uplifted in defiance, a strong party of the
enemy appeared, led by a tall and powerful-looking
chief, whose large armlets and anklets
of burnished copper shone in the evening
sunshine, and it was but too evident that,
under his auspices, mischief was at hand.
</p>

<p>
That they remarked Florian was an officer
was soon apparent, when two shots were
fired from each flank of the gorge; but these
whistled harmlessly past, and starred with
white a boulder in his rear.
</p>

<p>
'Pick off that fellow who is making himself
so prominent,' said Florian, with some
irritation, as his two escapes were narrow
ones.
</p>

<p>
One of the 24th fired and missed the leader.
</p>

<p>
'What distance did you sight your rifle
at?' asked Florian.
</p>

<p>
'Four hundred yards, sir,' replied the
soldier.
</p>

<p>
'Absurd!  He is certainly six hundred
yards off.  Do you try, Tyrrell.'
</p>

<p>
Then Tom, who was a deadly shot, reined
up, held his rifle straight between his horse's
ears, sighted at six hundred yards, and
pressing the butt firmly against his right
shoulder and restraining his breath, took aim
steadily at the chief, who stood prominently
on a fragment of rock, his figure defined
clearly against the blue sky like that of a
dark bronze statue.
</p>

<p>
He fired; the bullet pierced the Zulu's
forehead, as was afterwards discovered; he
fell backward and vanished from sight.
</p>

<p>
'By Jove, he's knocked over, sir,' said
Tom, with a quiet laugh, as he dropped
another cartridge into his breech-block, and
closed it with a snap.
</p>

<p>
'Bravo, Tom&mdash;a good shot!' said the men
of the 24th, while, with a yell of rage that
reverberated in the gorge, the Zulus fled,
and Florian's scouting party rode on at a
canter, and ultimately reached a deserted
German mission station at a place called
Rhinstorf.
</p>

<p>
As they rode through the gorge, with the
indifference that is born of war and its
details, Tom Tyrrell looked with perfect
composure on the man he had shot, and remarked
to Florian, with a smile:
</p>

<p>
'These Zulus are certainly one of the
connecting links that old Darwin writes about,
but links with the devil himself, I think.'
</p>

<p>
At the station of Rhinstorf Colonel Russell
now ascertained that fully thirty-five miles of
wild and rugged country would have to be
traversed ere he could reach Umkondo,
where Cetewayo was reported to be in
concealment.  To add to the difficulties of
proceeding further, night had fallen, the native
guide, having lost heart, had deserted, and
many of the horses had fallen lame by the
roughness of the route from Fort George;
thus Baker Russell came to the conclusion
that to proceed further then would be rash, if
not impossible.
</p>

<p>
Cetewayo still resisted all the terms offered
him, acting under the influence of Dabulamanzi,
who urged him to distrust the British,
in the hope that if the fugitive died of despair
in the forest of Ngome, he himself might
succeed to the throne of the Zulus.
</p>

<p>
While on this patrol duty our Mounted
Infantry came upon the remains of some of
our fellows who had fallen after the attack on
the Inhlobane Mountain in March and lain
unburied for nearly six months, exposed to
the weather and the Kaffir vultures.

<h3>
CHAPTER XII.
<br /><br />
AT THE 'RAG.'
</h3>

<p>
We now turn to a very different scene and
locality&mdash;to Regent Street, still deemed the
architectural <i>chef d'œuvre</i> of the celebrated
Mr. Nash, though it is all mere brick and
plaster.
</p>

<p>
The London season was past and over,
but one would hardly have thought so, as the
broad pavements seemed still so crowded,
and so many vehicles of every kind were
passing in close lines along the thoroughfare
from Waterloo Place to the Langham Hotel.
</p>

<p>
It was a bright sunny forenoon, and as
Vivian Hammersley, now a convalescent, and
in accurate morning mufti, looked on the
well-dressed throng, the shops filled with
everything the mind could desire or the
world produce, and at the entire aspect of the
well-swept street, he thought, after his recent
experience of forest and donga, of rocky
mountain and pathless karoo, that there was
nothing like it in Europe for an idler&mdash;that it
surpassed alike the Broadway of Uncle Sam
and the Grand Boulevard of Paris.
</p>

<p>
Enjoying the situation and his surroundings
to the fullest extent, he was walking
slowly down towards where the colonnades
stood of old, when suddenly he experienced
something between an electric shock and a
cold douche.
</p>

<p>
Both well mounted, a handsome fellow
attired in excellent taste, with a tea rose
and a green sprig in his lapel, and a graceful
girl in a well-fitting dark blue habit, a
dainty hat and short veil, ambled slowly past
him&mdash;so slowly that he could observe them
well&mdash;and in the latter he recognised
Finella!
</p>

<p>
Finella Melfort, mounted on her favourite
pad Fern; but <i>who</i> was this with whom she
seemed on such easy and laughing terms,
and with whom she was riding through the
streets of London, without even the escort of
a groom?
</p>

<p>
Erelong quickening their pace to a trot,
they turned westward along Conduit Street,
as if intending to 'do a bit of Park,' and he
lost sight of them.
</p>

<p>
Her companion was one whom Hammersley
had never seen before, but he could remark
that he had all the manner and appearance of
a man of good birth; but there was even
something more than that in his bearing&mdash;an
undefinable and indescribable air of interest
seemed to hover about them, and
Hammersley thought he might prove a very
formidable rival.  But surely matters had not
come to <i>that</i>!
</p>

<p>
To letters that he had addressed to
Finella at Craigengowan, under cover to
'Miss Carlyon,' no answer had ever been
returned.  He knew not that Dulcie was
no longer there, and that the letters referred
to had gone back to the Post Office.  And
so Finella's silence&mdash;was it indifference&mdash;seemed
unpleasantly accounted for now.
</p>

<p>
He knew not her address in London.
The house of the Fettercairn family was
shut up, and he could not accost her while
escorted by 'that fellow,' as she seemed ever
to be, for on two occasions he saw them
again in the Row; nor could he prosecute
any inquiries, as most of the mutual friends
at whose dances and garden parties he had
been wont to meet her in the past times
were now out of town.
</p>

<p>
It was tantalizing&mdash;exasperating!
</p>

<p>
Did she suppose he had been killed, and
had already forgotten him?  Did her heart
shrink from a vacuum, or what?  Thus pride
soon supplemented jealousy.
</p>

<p>
A few days after the third occasion on
which he had seen them, he was idling in the
reading-room of 'The Rag'&mdash;as the Army
and Navy Club is colloquially known, from
a joke in <i>Punch</i>, and the smoking-room of
which has the reputation of being the best in
London; and few, perhaps none, of those
who lounge therein are aware that the
stately edifice occupies what was the site
till 1790 of Nell Gwynne's house in Pall
Mall.
</p>

<p>
'How goes it, Hammersley?' said Villiers,
the aide-de-camp, who was also home on
leave, and <i>en route</i> to join his regiment,
being yet&mdash;as he grumblingly said&mdash;out of
'the Wolseley ring.'  'Has no Belgravian
belle succeeded in capturing you yet&mdash;a
hero, like myself, fresh from the assegais
of Ulundi and all that sort of thing?'
</p>

<p>
'No&mdash;I am still at large; but you forget
that by the time I reached town the season
was over.'
</p>

<p>
'Talking of belles,' said an officer who
was lounging in a window, 'here comes one
worth looking at.'
</p>

<p>
Finella and her cavalier, mounted again,
were quietly rambling into the square from
Pall Mall.
</p>

<p>
'Ah&mdash;she is with Garallan of the Bengal
Cavalry,' said Villiers; 'he has come in
for a good thing&mdash;has picked up an heiress, I
hear.'
</p>

<p>
'About the most useful thing a fellow can
pick up nowadays,' replied a tall officer
named Gore.
</p>

<p>
'That girl is said to be always ahead of the
London season.'
</p>

<p>
'How?'
</p>

<p>
'Dresses direct from Paris.'
</p>

<p>
'Garallan?' said Hammersley, turning from
the window, as the pair had disappeared.
</p>

<p>
'A Major of the old Second Irregular
Cavalry, and gained the V.C. when serving
on the Staff at the storming of Jummoo.'
</p>

<p>
'Jummoo&mdash;where the devil is that?' asked one.
</p>

<p>
'On the Peshawur frontier,' replied another;
'he is now in luck's way, certainly.'
</p>

<p>
'They say,' resumed Villiers in his laughing
off-hand way, and who really knew nothing
of Finella, but was merely ventilating some
club gossip, to the intense annoyance of
Hammersley; 'they say that she is a
coquette from her finger-tips to her tiny
balmorals, and would flirt with his Grace
of Canterbury if she got a chance; and yet,
with all that, she can be most sentimental.
There is Gore of ours&mdash;a passed practitioner
in the art of philandering&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Villiers, please to shut up,' said Hammersley
impatiently in a sotto voce; 'I know
the young lady, and you don't.'
</p>

<p>
'The deuce you do?'
</p>

<p>
'Intimately.'
</p>

<p>
Villiers coloured, and lapsed into silence.
</p>

<p>
'I always look upon flirtation as playing
with fire,' said Gore; 'never attempt it, but
I get into some deuced scrape.'
</p>

<p>
'How much money is muddled up with
matrimony in the world nowadays!' said
Villiers, thinking probably of the heiress's
thousands; 'I suppose it was different in
the days of our grandfathers.'
</p>

<p>
'Not much, I fancy,' said Gore.
</p>

<p>
Hammersley had now occasion for much
and somewhat bitter thought.  Finella and
this officer were evidently the subjects of
club gossip and not very well-bred banter;
the conviction galled him.
</p>

<p>
'Where the deuce or with whom does she
reside?' he thought; 'but to find anyone you
want, I don't know a more difficult place than
this big village on Thames.'
</p>

<p>
The wrong person&mdash;like himself apparently&mdash;turning
up at the wrong time is no new
experience to anyone; but this intimacy
of Finella and her cavalier seemed to be
a daily matter, as Hammersley had seen them
so often; and how often were they too
probably together on occasions that he could
know nothing of?
</p>

<p>
The germ of jealousy was now planted
in his heart, and 'such germs by force of
circumstances sometimes flourish and bear
bitter fruit; at others, nothing assisting, they
perish in the mind that gave them birth;' but
a new force was given to the remarks of
Villiers by some that Hammersley overheard
the same evening in the same place&mdash;the 'Rag.'
</p>

<p>
There he suddenly recognised Finella's
cavalier in full evening costume, eating his
dinner alone in a corner of the great
dining-room, and all unaware that he was sternly
and closely scrutinized by one man, and the
subject of conversation for other two, whose
somewhat flippant remarks from behind a
newspaper reached the ears of the former.
</p>

<p>
'Who is he, do you say?  His face is new
to me.'
</p>

<p>
'Ronald Garallan, of the Bengal Cavalry&mdash;a
lucky dog.'
</p>

<p>
'How so?'
</p>

<p>
'Is going in for a good thing, I hear.'
</p>

<p>
'For what?'
</p>

<p>
'His cousin with no end of tin.'
</p>

<p>
'His cousin?' questioned the other and
Hammersley's heart at the same time.
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;the handsome Miss Melfort with
the funny name&mdash;Finella Melfort.'
</p>

<p>
'So they are engaged?'
</p>

<p>
'I believe so; but I don't think from all I
hear that the Major has much of a vocation
for domesticity.'
</p>

<p>
'Even with Finella?'
</p>

<p>
'Even with Finella,' replied the other,
laughing.
</p>

<p>
Hammersley felt a dark frown gather on
his brow to hear her Christian name&mdash;<i>his</i>
property as he deemed it&mdash;used in this
off-hand fashion, and he felt a violent
inclination to punch his brother-officer's head.
However, he only moved his chair away
from the vicinity of the speakers, but not
before he heard one of them say to Garallan:
</p>

<p>
'Been to many dances since your return?
England, you know, expects every
marriageable bachelor to do his duty.'
</p>

<p>
'The season is over,' replied the Major
curtly; and then added, 'you forget that
I am on leave&mdash;the sick list, with a Medical
Board before me yet.'
</p>

<p>
'What a bore!  But you are bound for
some festive scene to-night, I presume?'
</p>

<p>
'Only to the Lyceum.'
</p>

<p>
'<i>The Lyceum</i>&mdash;with her perhaps,' thought
Hammersley; and to see the affair out to the
bitter end, he resolved to go there too.
</p>

<p>
He was cut to the heart again, and bit
his nether lip to preserve his self-control.
He had never heard of this cousin, Ronald
Garallan; he certainly found his name in the
Army List, but did not believe he was
any cousin at all; and this only served
to make matters look more and more black.
</p>

<p>
Hammersley in his natural pride of spirit
rather revolted at going to the theatre, feeling
as if he was acting somewhat like a spy,
but he had a right to learn for himself what
was on the tapis with regard to Finella; and
the Lyceum was as free a theatre to him
as to anyone else; so a few minutes after
saw him bowling along the Strand in a
hansom cab.
</p>

<p>
He got a seat on the grand tier, but
with difficulty, and, fortunately for his purpose,
a little back and well out of sight; and,
oblivious of the stage and all the usual scenic
splendours there, he swept 'the house' again
and again, with the same powerful field-glass
he had so lately used on many a scouting
expedition, but in vain, till the crimson satin
curtain of a private box was suddenly drawn
back, and Finella in a perfect costume, yet
not quite full dress, sat there like a little
queen, with many a sparkling jewel, and
Garallan half leaning on the back of her
chair, as she consulted the programme, after
depositing a beautiful bouquet and her
opera-glass on the front of the box before her.
</p>

<p>
Hammersley's heart seemed to give a leap,
and then stood still, while he actually felt an
ache in the bullet wound which had so nearly
cost him his life.
</p>

<p>
There they were, in a private box together,
and without a chaperone, which certainly
looked like cousinship, though every way
distasteful to Hammersley; and Garallan
leant over her chair, ignoring the performance
entirely, and evidently entertaining her in
'that original and delicious strain in which
Adam and Eve were probably the first proficients.'
</p>

<p>
And Finella was smiling upwards at times
with her radiant eyes and <i>riant</i> face, with
the bright and happy expression of one
who had nothing left to wish for in the
world; while he&mdash;Vivian Hammersley&mdash;might
be, for all she knew or seemed to
care, lying unburied by the banks of the
Umvolosi or the Lower Tugela!
</p>

<p>
He recalled the words of her letter, so
long and so loving, which he received so
unexpectedly in Zululand, in which she
urged him to be brave of heart for her sake,
and not to be discouraged by any opposition
on the part of Lady Fettercairn, as she was
rich enough to please herself, adding:
</p>

<p>
'Let us have perfect confidence in each
other!  Oh, you passionate silly! to run
away in a rage as you did without seeking an
explanation.  How much it has cost me
Heaven alone knows!'
</p>

<p>
'Now,' thought he, 'suppose all the explanation
she gave Miss Carlyon at Craigengowan
of that remarkable scene in the shrubbery,
or that she was lured into a scrape with that
cub Shafto, were mere humbug after all.  It
looks deuced like it from what I see going on
here in London.  And then the rings I gave
her&mdash;one a marriage hoop to keep&mdash;an
unlucky gift&mdash;ha! ha! what a precious ass
I have been!'
</p>

<p>
Vivian Hammersley, though a tough-looking
and well set-up linesman, was of an
imaginative cast, and of a highly sensitive
nature, and such are usually well skilled in
the art of elaborate self-torture.
</p>

<p>
He now perceived that for a moment
she had drawn the glove from off her left
hand&mdash;what a lovely little white hand it was!
He turned his powerful field-glass thereon,
with more interest and curiosity than he had
done while watching for Zulu warriors, and
there&mdash;yes&mdash;there by Jove!&mdash;his heart gave
a bound&mdash;was his engagement ring upon her
engaged finger still&mdash;there was no doubt
about that!
</p>

<p>
So what did all this too apparent philandering
with another mean, if not the most arrant
coquetry?  Had her character changed within
a few short months?  It almost seemed so.
</p>

<p>
But Hammersley thought that, 'tide what
may,' he had seen enough of the Lyceum for
that night, and hurried away to the
smoking-room of the 'Rag.'

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII.
<br /><br />
A REVELATION.
</h3>

<p>
We have written somewhat ahead of our
general narrative, and must now recur to
Lord Fettercairn's visit to Mr. Kenneth
Kippilaw in Edinburgh, at that gentleman's
request&mdash;one which filled the old Peer with
some surprise.
</p>

<p>
'Why the deuce did not his agent visit
him?' he thought.
</p>

<p>
Smarting under Shafto's insolence, and
acting on information given to him readily
by Madelon Galbraith, Mr. Kippilaw took
certain measures to obtain some light on a
matter which he should have taken before.
</p>

<p>
'You look somewhat unhinged, Kippilaw,'
said Lord Fettercairn, as he seated himself
in the former's private business room.
</p>

<p>
'I feel so, my lord,' replied the lawyer, in
a fidgety way, as he breathed upon and
wiped his spectacles; 'I have to talk over
an unpleasant matter with you.'
</p>

<p>
'Business?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes; perhaps you would defer it till after
dinner?'
</p>

<p>
'Not at all&mdash;what the deuce is it?  Debts
of Shafto's?'
</p>

<p>
'Worse, my lord!'
</p>

<p>
'Worse!  You actually seem unwell;
have a glass of sherry, if I may press you
in your own house.'
</p>

<p>
'No thanks; I am in positive distress.'
</p>

<p>
'How&mdash;about what?' asked the Peer impatiently.
</p>

<p>
'The fact is, my lord, I don't know how to
go about it and explain; but for the first
time since I began my career as a W.S.&mdash;some
forty years ago now&mdash;I have made a
great professional blunder, I fear.'
</p>

<p>
'Sorry to hear it&mdash;but what have I to do
with all that?'
</p>

<p>
'Much.'
</p>

<p>
Lord Fettercairn changed colour.
</p>

<p>
'You wrote strangely of Shafto?'
</p>

<p>
'No wonder!' groaned Mr. Kippilaw.
</p>

<p>
'How?'
</p>

<p>
'The matter very nearly affects your lordship's
dearest interests&mdash;the honour of your
house and title.'
</p>

<p>
'The devil!' exclaimed the Peer, starting
up, and touched upon his most tender
point.
</p>

<p>
'I have had more than one long conversation
with the old nurse, Madelon Galbraith,
and therefore instituted certain inquiries,
which I should have done before, and have
come to the undoubted and legal conclusion
that&mdash;that&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'What?' asked Fettercairn, striking the
floor with his right heel.
</p>

<p>
'That the person who passes as your
grandson is not your grandson at all!'
</p>

<p>
'What&mdash;how&mdash;who the devil is he then?'
</p>

<p>
'The son of a Miss MacIan who married
a Mr. Shafto Gyle.'
</p>

<p>
'D&mdash;n the name!  Then who and where
is my grandson and heir?'
</p>

<p>
'One who was lately or is now serving as
a soldier in Zululand.'
</p>

<p>
'My God!  and you tell me all this now&mdash;<i>now</i>?'
</p>

<p>
'When Lennard Melfort lay dying at
Revelstoke he entrusted the proofs of his
only son's birth with his older nephew,
Shafto, who, with amazing cunning, used
them to usurp his rights and position.  I
blame myself much.  I should have made
closer inquiries at the time; but the
documents seemed all and every way to the point,
and I could not doubt the handwriting or the
signatures of your poor dead son.  The
result, however, has rather stunned me.'
</p>

<p>
'And, d&mdash;n it, Kippilaw, it rather stuns
me!' exclaimed Lord Fettercairn, in high
wrath.  'May it not be a mistake, this last
idea?'
</p>

<p>
'No&mdash;everything is too well authenticated.'
</p>

<p>
'But, Kippilaw,' said Lord Fettercairn,
after a pause, caused by dire perplexity, 'we
had the certificate of birth.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;but not in Shafto's name.  The
document was mutilated and without the
baptismal certificate, of which I have got
this copy from the Rev. Mr. Paul Pentreath.
The name in both is, as you see,' added
Mr. Kippilaw, laying the document on the table,
'Florian, only son of the Hon. Lennard
Melfort (otherwise MacIan) and Flora, his
wife&mdash;Florian, called so after her.'
</p>

<p>
'You have seen this young man?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;once in this room, and I was struck
with his likeness to Lennard.  He is dark,
Shafto fair.  The true heir has a peculiar
mark on his right arm, says Madelon
Galbraith, his nurse.  Here is a letter from
a doctor of the regiment stating that Florian
has such a mark, which Shafto has not; and
mother-marks, as they are called, never
change, like the two marks of the famous
"Claimant."
</p>

<p>
'I cannot realize it all&mdash;that we have been
so befooled!' exclaimed Lord Fettercairn,
walking up and down the room.
</p>

<p>
'But you must; it will come home to you
soon enough.'
</p>

<p>
'Egad, so far as bills and debts go, it has
come home to me sharply enough already.
It is a terrible story&mdash;a startling one.'
</p>

<p>
'Few families have stories like it.'
</p>

<p>
'And one does not wish such in one's own
experience, Kippilaw.  It is difficult of
belief&mdash;monstrous, Kippilaw!'
</p>

<p>
'Monstrous, indeed, my Lord Fettercairn!'
chimed in Mr. Kippilaw, who then proceeded
to unfold a terrible tale of the results of
Shafto's periodical visits to Edinburgh and
London&mdash;his bills and post-obits with the
money-lenders, who would all be 'diddled'
now, as he proved not to be the heir at all;
and though last, not least, his late disgraceful
affair of the loaded die, and the fracas with
Major Garallan.
</p>

<p>
'Garallan! that old woman Drumshoddy's
nephew&mdash;whew!'  His lordship perspired
with pure vexation.  'I have to thank you,
however, for finding out the true heir at last.'
</p>

<p>
'When there are a fortune and a title in
the case, people are easily found, my lord.'
</p>

<p>
'Things come right generally, as they
always do, if one waits and trusts in God,'
said Madelon Galbraith, when she was
admitted to an audience, in which, with the
garrulity of years, she supplemented all that
Mr. Kippilaw had advanced; and, as she
laughed with exultation, she showed&mdash;despite
her age&mdash;two rows of magnificent teeth&mdash;teeth
that were bright as her eyes were dark.
</p>

<p>
'Laoghe mo chri!  Laoghe mo chri!' she
murmured to herself; 'your only son will be
righted yet.'
</p>

<p>
Every nation has its own peculiar terms of
endearment, so Madelon naturally referred to
Flora in her own native Gaelic.
</p>

<p>
'And Florian is&mdash;as you say, Kippilaw&mdash;serving
in Zululand?' said Lord Fettercairn.
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'Serving as a private soldier?'
</p>

<p>
'He was&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Was&mdash;is he dead?' interrupted the Peer sharply.
</p>

<p>
'No; he is now an officer, and a
distinguished one&mdash;an officer of the gallant but
most unfortunate 24th.  I have learned that much.'
</p>

<p>
'Write to him at once, and meanwhile
telegraph to the Adjutant-General&mdash;no
matter what the expense&mdash;for immediate
intelligence about him.  You will also write to
Shafto&mdash;you know what to say to <i>him</i>.'
</p>

<p>
With right goodwill Mr. Kippilaw hastened
to obey the Peer's injunctions in both
instances.
</p>

<p>
He wrote to Shafto curtly, relating all that
had transpired, adding that he (Shafto) could
not retain his present position for another
day without risking a public trial, and that if
he would confess the vile and cruel imposture
of which he had been guilty he might escape
being sent to prison, and obtaining perhaps
'permanent employment' in the Perth Penitentiary.
</p>

<p>
This letter&mdash;though not unexpected&mdash;proved
a most bitter pill to Shafto!  He saw
that 'the game was up'&mdash;his last card
played, that life had no more in it for him,
and that there was nothing left for him but
to fly the country and his debts together.
</p>

<p>
His face was set hard, and into his shifty
grey eyes came the savage gleam one may
see in those of a cat before it springs, but
with this expression were mingled rage and
fear.
</p>

<p>
With Mr. Kippilaw's letter were two
others, from different parties.  In one he
was informed that legal proceedings had
been taken against him, and in default of his
putting in an appearance, judgment for
execution and costs had been given against
him in an English court, for £847 16s. 8d.,
in favour of a Jew, who held another bill,
which, though it originally represented £400,
would cost £800 before he parted with it;
and Shafto actually laughed a little bitter
and discordant laugh as he rent the lawyers'
letters into fragments and cast them to the
wind.
</p>

<p>
Before departing, however, and before his
story transpired, he contrived to borrow
from the butler and housekeeper every spare
pound they possessed, and quietly went forth,
portmanteau in hand.
</p>

<p>
Did he as he thus left the house recall the
auspicious day on which he had first seen,
with keen and avaricious exultation, Craigengowan
in all its baronial beauty, its wealth of
pasture and meadow-land, of wood, and
moor, and mountain, and deemed that
all&mdash;all were, or would be, his?
</p>

<p>
He turned his back on the Howe of the
Mearns for ever, and from that hour all trace
of him was lost!
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
The reply to Mr. Kippilaw's telegram to
South Africa gave him, and even his noble
client, cause for some anxiety.
</p>

<p>
It was dated from Headquarters, Ulundi,
on the last day of August, and stated that
Lieutenant MacIan 'was down with fever,
and not expected to live.'
</p>

<p>
So&mdash;if he died&mdash;the title of Fettercairn,
being a Scottish one, would go to Finella,
and the heir male of whosoever she
married.

<p><a id="chap14"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV.
<br /><br />
IN THE NGOME FOREST.
</h3>

<p>
We now approach the last scenes of Florian's
foreign service.
</p>

<p>
By the 13th of August the cordon of
European troops and Native lines drawn
round the district in which the fugitive
King of the Zulus lurked had been drawn
closer, and it was now distinctly known at
headquarters in Ulundi that he had sought
refuge in the Forest of Ngome, a wild, most
savage and untrodden district between two
rivers (with long and grotesque names),
tributaries of the Black Umvolosi, and
overshadowed by a mountain chain called the
Ngome.
</p>

<p>
Various parties detailed for the pursuit,
search, and capture failed, till, on the 26th
August, the Chief of the Staff received
information indicating where Cetewayo was
certain to be found, and Major Marter, of the
King's Dragoon Guards, was ordered to
proceed next day in that direction with a
squadron of his own regiment, a company of
the Native Contingent, Lonsdale's Horse,
and a few Mounted Infantry, led by Florian
and another officer.  The former was already
suffering from fever caught by exposure to
the night dews when scouting, and felt so
weak and giddy that at times he could barely
keep in his saddle; but, full of youthful
ardour and zeal, fired by the promotion
and praises he had won, he was anxious
only, if life were spared him, to see the
closing act of the great campaign in South
Africa.
</p>

<p>
The early morning of the 27th saw the
Horse depart, the King's Dragoon Guards
leading the way, after the Mounted Infantry
scouts; and picturesque they looked in their
bright scarlet tunics and white helmets, with
accoutrements glittering as they rode in
Indian file through the scenery of the
tropical forest, and then for a time debouched
upon open ground.
</p>

<p>
Nodding in his saddle, Florian felt spiritless
and sick at heart, wishing intensely that
the last act was over.
</p>

<p>
Far in the distance around extended a
range of mountains that were purple and
blue in their hues, even against the
greenish-blue of the sky, and vast tracts of wood,
tinted with every hue of green, red, and
golden; in the foreground were brawling
streams dashing through channels of rock to
join the Black Umvolosi, under graceful date
palms, mimosa trees, and the undergrowth
of baboon ropes and other giant trailers.
Scared troops of the eland, grey and brown
herds of fleet antelopes glided past, and more,
than once the roar of a lion made the
wilderness re-echo.
</p>

<p>
And this ground had to be traversed
under a fierce and burning sun till the valley
of the Ivuno River was reached, prior to
which three Dragoon Guard horses were
carried off and devoured by lions.
</p>

<p>
So passed the day.  The party reached a
lonely little kraal on the summit of the
Nenye Mountain, and bivouacked there for
the night.
</p>

<p>
Stretched on the floor of a hut, after drinking
thirstily of some weak brandy and water,
Florian watched the blood-red disc of the
sun, mightier than it is ever seen in Europe,
amid the luminous haze, begin to disappear
behind the verge of the vast forest&mdash;the sea
of timber&mdash;that spread below, casting forward
in dark outline the quaint and grotesque
euphorbia trees that at times take the shape
of Indian idols.
</p>

<p>
Then a mist stole over the waste below,
and a single star shone out with wondrous
brilliance.
</p>

<p>
Florian was so weak in the morning that
he would fain have abandoned the duty on
which he had come, and remained in the hut
at the kraal; but to linger behind was only
to court death by the teeth of wild animals or
the hands of scouting Zulus, so wearily he
clambered, rather than sprang as of old, into
his saddle.
</p>

<p>
'Pull yourself together, if you can, my
dear fellow,' said an officer; 'our task will
soon be over.  It is something after a close
run to be in at the death; and it is waking
men with their swords, not dreamers with
their pens, who make history.'
</p>

<p>
'I am no dreamer,' said Florian, scarcely
seeing the point of the other's remark.
</p>

<p>
'I did not mean that you were,' said the
other, proffering his cigar-case; 'have a
weed?'
</p>

<p>
But Florian shook his head with an
emotion of nausea.
</p>

<p>
'Forward, in single file from the right,'
was the order given, for the sun would soon
be up now.  Already the bees were humming
loudly among the tall reeds and giant
flowers beside the stream that flowed downward
from the kraal, the forest stems looked
black or bronze-like in the grey and then
crimson dawn, while the stars faded out
fast.
</p>

<p>
In advancing to another kraal on the
mountain, Major Marter's force had to
traverse the forest bush, where trees of
giant height and girth, matted and
inter-woven by baboon ropes and other trailers,
shut out even the fierce sun of Africa, and
made a cool green roof or leafy shade, where
the grass grew tall as a Grenadier, where
hideous apes barked and chattered, bright-hued
parrots croaked or screamed, and where
nature seemed to have run wild in unbridled
luxuriance since the Ark rested on Ararat,
and the waters of the flood subsided.
</p>

<p>
The mountains of the Ngome, and overlooking
the forest of that name, are flat-topped,
like all others in South Africa; but
Major Marter found the western slope to be
dangerously precipitous, and thence he and
his guides looked down into a densely
wooded valley, lying more than two thousand
feet below.
</p>

<p>
About two miles distant, thin smoke could
be seen ascending amid the greenery, from a
small kraal by the side of a brawling stream,
and therein Cetewayo was known to be.
</p>

<p>
As cavalry could not reach the bottom
without making a very long detour, the
Major ordered all the mounted men to lay
aside their bright steel scabbards, and all
other accoutrements likely to create a rattling
noise, and these, with the pack horses, were
left in charge of a small party, the command
of which was offered to the sinking Florian,
who foolishly declined, and rode with the
rest to a less precipitous slope of the hills
three miles distant, down which the Dragoon
Guards led their chargers by the bridle,
crossed the stream referred to, a small fence,
and a marsh, and, remounting, made a dash
for the kraal, sword in hand, from the north,
while the Native Contingent formed up south
of it on some open ground.
</p>

<p>
The capture of Cetewayo is an event too
recent to be detailed at length here.
</p>

<p>
It is known how his few followers, on
seeing the red-coated cavalry riding up,
shouted, in unison with the Native Contingent:
</p>

<p>
'The white men are here&mdash;you are taken!'
</p>

<p>
Then the fallen royal savage came forth,
looking weary, weak, and footsore; and
when a soldier&mdash;Tom Tyrrell&mdash;attempted to
seize him, he drew himself up with an air of
simple dignity, and repelled him.
</p>

<p>
'Touch me not, white soldier!' he
exclaimed; 'I am a King, and surrender only
to your chief.'
</p>

<p>
With their prisoner strictly guarded, the
party passed the night of the 29th August in
the forest of Ngome, and Florian, as he flung
himself on the dewy grass, with fevered
limbs and aching head, felt an emotion of
thankfulness that all was over, and it was
nearly so with himself now!
</p>

<p>
The moon had not yet risen; the darkness
was dense around the hut where lay Cetewayo,
guarded by many a sabre and bayonet;
and the jackals and hyenas were making
night hideous with their howling, mingled
at times with the yells of wild dogs.
</p>

<p>
Ever and anon the barking of baboons, as
they swung themselves from branch to branch,
seemed to indicate the approach of some
great beast of prey, and the crackle of dry
twigs suggested the slimy crawling of a
poisonous snake.
</p>

<p>
So passed the night in the Forest of
Ngome.  With dawn the trumpet sounded
'To horse,' and again the whole party moved
on the homeward way to Ulundi.  The
night in the dreary forest, lying out in the
open, had done its worst for Florian.  On
reaching the camp he fell from his saddle
into the arms of the watchful Tom Tyrrell,
and was carried to his tent, prostrate and
delirious.
</p>

<p>
Hence the tenor of the telegram received
from the medical staff by Mr. Kenneth Kippilaw.
</p>

<p>
How Florian lived to reach Durban, conveyed
there with other sick in the ambulance
waggons, he never knew, so heavily was the
hand of fever laid on him; but many a time
he had seen, as in a dream, the horses straggling
through bridgeless torrents, and graves
dug amid the pathless wastes for those who
died on the route, and were laid therein,
rolled in their blanket, and covered up before
their limbs were cold, till at last the village of
Durban&mdash;for it is little else, though the principal
seaport of Natal&mdash;was reached, and he
was placed in an extemporised hospital.
</p>

<p>
In his weakness, after the delirium passed
away, he felt always as one in a dream.  The
windows were open to the breeze from the
Indian Ocean, and the roar of the surf could
be heard without ceasing on the sandy beach,
while at night the sharp crescent moon shone
like a silver sabre in the clear blue sky, and,
laden with the perfume of many tropical
plants, the sweet air without struggled with
the close atmosphere of the crowded hospital
wards, in which our 'boy soldiers died like
sick flies,' as a general officer reported.
</p>

<p>
And there he lay, hour after hour, wasted
by the fever born of miasma and the jungle,
rigid and corpse-like in outline, under the
light white coverlet.  For how long or how
short this was to last no one ventured to surmise.
</p>

<p>
He had ceased now to toss to and fro on
his pillow and pour forth incoherent babble,
in which Revelstoke, Dulcie Carlyon, his
boyish days, and the recent stirring events of
the now-ended campaign were all strangely
woven together, while Tom Tyrrell, now his
constant attendant, who nursed him tenderly
as a woman would have done, had listened
with alarm and dismay.  And more than once
Florian had dreamed that Tom, bearded to
the eyes, bronzed to negro darkness, and
clad in an old patched regimental tunic, was
not Tom at all, but Dulcie, the girl he loved
so passionately, watching there, smoothing his
pillow and holding the cup with its cooling
draught to his parched lips.
</p>

<p>
'They say that fever must run its course,
sir, whatever that means,' said Tom to the
doctor.
</p>

<p>
'Ah! a fever like this is a very touch-and-go
affair,' responded old Gallipot, in whom
the telegrams from headquarters and from
Edinburgh had given a peculiar interest for
his patient.
</p>

<p>
'Am I dying, doctor&mdash;don't fear to tell
me?' asked the latter suddenly in a low,
husky voice.
</p>

<p>
'Why do you ask, my poor fellow?' replied
the doctor, bending over him.
</p>

<p>
'I mean simply, is the end of this illness&mdash;death?'
</p>

<p>
'To tell you the truth, I greatly fear it is,'
replied the doctor, shaking his head.
</p>

<p>
'God's will be done!' said Florian
resignedly.  'Well, well, perhaps it is better
so&mdash;I am so far gone&mdash;but Dulcie!' he added
to himself in a husky whisper&mdash;'poor Dulcie,
alone&mdash;all alone!'
</p>

<p>
His senses had quite returned now, but he
was so weak that he could neither move
hand nor foot, and his eyelids, unable to
uphold their own weight, closed as soon as
raised, and often while his parched tongue
clove to the roof of his mouth as he lay thus
he was supposed to be asleep.
</p>

<p>
'Poor fellow!' he heard Tom Tyrrell
whisper to an hospital orderly in a broken
voice; 'he's got his marching orders, and
will soon be off&mdash;yet he doesn't seem to
suffer much.'
</p>

<p>
How hard it was to die so young, with
what should have been a long life before him,
and now one with honours won to make it
valuable.
</p>

<p>
Well, well, he thought, if it was God's will
it would be no worse for him than for others.
It seemed as natural to die as to be born&mdash;our
place in the world is vacant before and
after; but yet, again, it was hard, he thought,
to die, and die so young in a distant and
barbarous land, where the savage, the wild
animal, and the Kaffir vulture would be the
only loiterers near his lonely and unmarked
grave.
</p>

<p>
There came a day when the scene changed
to him again.  He was in the cabin of a ship,
lying near an open port-hole, through which
he could see the ocean rippling like molten
gold in the setting sun, the red light of which
bathed in ruddy tints the shore of Durban
and the white lighthouse on the bluff that
guards its entrance.
</p>

<p>
Anon he heard the tramp overhead of the
seamen as they manned the capstan bars and
tripped merrily round to the sound of drum
and fife, heaving short on the anchor, and
heaving with a will, till it was apeak.  Then,
the canvas was let fall and sheeted home;
the revolution of the screw-propeller was felt
to make the great 'trooper' vibrate in all her
length, and the glittering waves began to
roll astern as she sped on her homeward
way.
</p>

<p>
Would he live to see the end of the
voyage?  It seemed very problematical.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XV.
<br /><br />
THE MAJOR PROPOSES.
</h3>

<p>
Meanwhile Hammersley's suspicion and
jealousy grew apace, and it has been said
that when the latter emotion begins to
reason, we legally 'always hold a brief for
the prosecution in such cases, and admit no
evidence save that which tends to a conviction.'
</p>

<p>
In his rage he thought of quitting London
and going&mdash;but where?  He knew not then
precisely.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, to be well and strong again!' he
would mutter; 'out of this place and back to
the regiment and the old life.  There is a
shindy brewing fast in the Transvaal, and
that will be the place for me.'
</p>

<p>
At other times he would think&mdash;'I wish
that recruit of Cardwell's had put his bullet
through my brain.  I would rather he had
done so than feel it throb as it does now.'
</p>

<p>
Some loves may dwindle into indifference
or turn to hatred, but seldom or never to mere
friendship.  Yet it is not easy 'to hate those
we have once loved because we happen to
discover a weak point in their armour, any
more than it is easy to love unlovable people
because of their resplendent virtues.'
</p>

<p>
No response had ever come to the letters
he had written Finella under cover to Dulce;
thus he ceased to send them, all unaware that
these letters addressed to 'Miss Carlyon' had
been returned to the Post Office, endorsed,
by order of Lady Fettercairn, 'not known at
Craigengowan;' and now the heavy thoughts
of Hammersley affected his manner and gait,
and thus he often walked slowly, as if he
were weary; and so he was weary and sick
of heart, for the sense of hope being dead
within the breast will give a droop to the
head and a lagging air to the step.
</p>

<p>
Lady Drumshoddy rented a grand
old-fashioned house in that very gloomy
quadrangle called St. James's Square, the chief
mansion in which is that of his Grace of
Norfolk, and round the still somewhat scurvy
enclosure of which Dr. Johnson and Savage,
when friendless and penniless, spent many a
summer night with empty stomachs and
hearts heated with antagonism to the then
Government.  About a hundred years before
that, Macaulay tells us that St. James's
Square 'was a receptacle for all the offal and
cinders, and all the dead cats and dogs, of
Westminster.  At one time a cudgel-player
kept his ring there.  At another an impudent
squatter settled himself there, and built a
shed for rubbish under the windows of the
gilded <i>salons</i> in which the first magnates of
the realm&mdash;Norfolk, Ormond, Kent, and
Pembroke&mdash;gave banquets and balls.  It was
not till these nuisances had lasted through a
whole generation, and till much had been
written about them, that the inhabitants
applied to Parliament for permission to put
up rails and plant trees.'
</p>

<p>
Here, then, in this now fashionable locality,
had my Lady Drumshoddy pitched her tent,
and hence it was that Vivian Hammersley,
being almost daily at 'The Rag,' close by,
saw Finella and her cousin so frequently;
yet it never occurred to him to think of the
old Scoto-Indian Judge's widow, of whom he
knew little or nothing.
</p>

<p>
The circumstance that Finella was
undoubtedly still wearing his engagement ring
made Hammersley, amid all his misery and
anger, long for some more certain information
than mere Club gossip and banter
afforded, and for that which was due from
her&mdash;an explicit explanation.  He thought,
as a casuist has it, 'that to know her false
would not be so bitter as to doubt.  To
mistrust the woman we love is torture.  To
have a knowledge of her guilt is the first step
towards burying our love.  Our pride is then
thoroughly aroused, and that contempt for
treachery, inherent in our nature, flames out.'
</p>

<p>
On her part, Finella had some cause for
pique&mdash;grave cause, she thought.  She had
twice, at intervals, seen Vivian Hammersley
riding in the Row, when it was impossible
for her to address him or afford him the
least sign; and now, knowing that he was
home, and in London, she naturally thought
why did he not make some effort to communicate
with her, in spite of any barrier Lady
Fettercairn might raise between them, if he
supposed she still resided at Craigengowan.
Thus she too was beginning to look regretfully
back to his love as a dream that had fled.
</p>

<p>
'A pretty kettle of fish they have made
of it at Craigengowan, my dear!' snorted
Lady Drumshoddy, when she heard of the
late events that had transpired there.  'They
have been imposed upon fearfully&mdash;quite
another "Claimant" affair; but I always had
my suspicions, my dear&mdash;I always had my
suspicions, I am glad to say,' she coolly
added, oblivious of the fact that she always
aided and abetted Shafto in all his plans and
hopes to secure Finella and her fortune.
</p>

<p>
It was convenient to ignore or forget all
that now.
</p>

<p>
'My Ronald is all right,' snorted the
hard-featured old dame to herself; 'he is the
right man in the right place; but, as for
Finella, she is like most girls, I suppose&mdash;will
not fall in love where and when it is
most clearly her duty to do so&mdash;provoking
minx!'
</p>

<p>
It was a prominent feature in the character
of my Lady Drumshoddy, contradiction,
though she would not for a second tolerate it
in anyone else; and as Major Garallan was
temporarily a resident at her house in
St. James's Square, she, like Lady Fettercairn
on the other occasion, put great faith in
cousinship and propinquity.
</p>

<p>
What a different kind and style of cousin
Ronald Garallan was from Shafto, Finella
naturally thought; not that as yet she loved
him a bit, as he evidently loved her, but he
was such a delightful companion to escort
her everywhere.
</p>

<p>
She had received plenty of admiration and
adulation during her short season in London
before, and to suppose that she was blind to
the young Major's attentions would be to
deem her foolish; no woman or girl is ever
blind to that sort of thing.  She, like the rest
of her charming sex, knew by instinct when
she had won a success; but she also knew
that she had one powerful attraction&mdash;money&mdash;and
knew, too, that her heart was engaged
otherwise; and this knowledge made her
tolerably indifferent to the admiration of her
cousin, while the indifference laid her open to
the appearance of receiving his close attentions.
Meanwhile the latter was enjoying his Capua.
</p>

<p>
'How delicious all this is!' he often
thought, as he lounged by Finella's side in
the drawing-room, or rode with her in the
Row, 'after sweltering so long in that hottest
and most hateful of up-country stations,
Jehanabad, on the shining rocks of which
the Indian sun pours all its rays for months,
till the granite at night gives out the caloric
it has absorbed by day, and so the roasting
process never ceases, and sleep even on a
charpoy becomes impossible, all the more so
that hyenas, jackals, and wild cats make
night hideous with their yells.  This is
indeed an exchange,' he once added aloud,
'and all the more delicious that I have it
with <i>you</i>, Cousin Finella.'
</p>

<p>
And Lady Drumshoddy, if she was near,
would watch the pair complacently through
her great spectacles, while pretending to be
intent on her only paper (after the <i>Morning
Post</i>), the <i>Queen</i>, which she read as regularly&mdash;more
so, we fear&mdash;than she read her night prayers.
</p>

<p>
And while Garallan's attentions were
gradually warming and leading up to a
declaration, Finella was thinking angrily of
Hammersley.
</p>

<p>
'Perhaps he has forgotten his love for
me&mdash;nay, he would never forget <i>that!</i> but
absence, time, change of scene, or a regard
for some one else may have come between
us.  It is the way with men, I have been
told.'
</p>

<p>
So, in the fulness of time, there came one
fine forenoon, when Lady Drumshoddy had
judiciously left the cousins quite alone, and
when Finella, in one of her most bewitching
costumes, was idling over a book of prints,
with Ronald Garallan by her side, admiring
the contour of her head, the curve of her
neck, her pure profile, the lovely little ear
that was next him, and everything else, to
the little bouquet in her bosom that rose and
fell with every respiration, let his passion
completely overmaster him, and taking caressingly
within his own her left hand, which she
did not withdraw, he said:
</p>

<p>
'I have something to ask you, Finella&mdash;you
know what it is?'
</p>

<p>
'Indeed, I do not.'
</p>

<p>
'Then, of course, I must tell you?'
</p>

<p>
'I think you must,' said she, looking him
calmly in the face for a second.
</p>

<p>
'For weeks you must have known it.'
</p>

<p>
'Known&mdash;what?'
</p>

<p>
'That I love you!' he said in a low voice,
and bending till his moustache touched her
cheek; 'and now I ask you to give me
yourself.'
</p>

<p>
The hand was withdrawn now; she
coloured, but not deeply, and her eyelashes
drooped.
</p>

<p>
'Give me yourself, darling,' he resumed,
'and trust to me for taking care of you all
the days of your life.'
</p>

<p>
Though she must have expected some
such ending as this to their late hourly
intimacy, she was nevertheless astonished,
and said, with a little nervous laugh at the
abruptness and matter-of-fact form of the
proposal:
</p>

<p>
'Cousin Ronald, I can surely take care of
myself.  But&mdash;but do you want to marry me?'
</p>

<p>
'Of course!' replied Cousin Ronald, with
very open eyes, while tugging the ends of
his moustache.
</p>

<p>
'Well&mdash;it can't be.'
</p>

<p>
'Can't be?'
</p>

<p>
'No.  I thank you very much, and like
you very much&mdash;there are both my hands on
that; but marriage is impossible.  Yet don't
let us quarrel, for that would be absurd, but
be the best of good friends as ever.'
</p>

<p>
'And this is my answer?' said he, with a
very crushed air.
</p>

<p>
'Yes,' she replied, colouring deeply now;
'once and for all.'
</p>

<p>
'I won't take it,' said he, with mingled
sorrow and anger.  'I will not, darling!&mdash;I
shall come to it again, when, perhaps, you
may think better of it and of me.  Till
then good-bye, and God bless you, dearest
Finella!'
</p>

<p>
Kissing both her hands, he abruptly withdrew,
and soon after leaving the house took
his departure for Brighton; and now the luckless
Finella had to explain the reason thereof,
and to undergo the ever-recurring admonitions,
reprehensions, parables, and absolute
scoldings of 'grandmamma Drumshoddy,'
who was neither quite so well bred nor so
calm in spirit and outward bearing as Lady
Fettercairn, then 'eating humble pie' at
Craigengowan.
</p>

<p>
If Florian, the new heir, was indeed dying,
as reported, when he was embarked with
other sick and wounded officers and men at
Durban, a prospective peerage, with all the
estates, enhanced the value and position of
Finella in the eyes of Lady Drumshoddy, so
far as a marriage with her nephew, the
Major, was concerned, and most wrathful
she was indeed to find that her schemes
were going 'agee.'
</p>

<p>
Lord Fettercairn fully shared her ideas,
and knew that whoever married the only
daughter of the House of Melfort, though
he might assume the old name, it and the
title too went virtually out of the family.
</p>

<p>
Finella had remarked to herself that for
some time past Lady Fettercairn in her
letters never mentioned the name of Shafto,
or hinted of the old wish about marrying
<i>him</i>.
</p>

<p>
Why was this?
</p>

<p>
She knew not the reason that his existence
was ignored, till Lady Drumshoddy bluntly
referred to 'the pretty kettle of fish' made
lately by the folks at Craigengowan, and
then, in the gentleness of her heart, Finella
almost felt pitiful for the now homeless and
worthless one.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVI.
<br /><br />
A CLOUD DISPELLED.
</h3>

<p>
September was creeping on, and in London
then the weather is often steady and pleasant,
though in the mornings and evenings the
first chills of the coming winter begin to be
felt.  The summer-parched and dust-laden
foliage of the trees droops in Park and
square, and the great gorse-bushes are all
in golden bloom at Wimbledon, at Barnes
Common, and other fern and heath-covered
wastes.
</p>

<p>
The Row and other favourite promenades
were now empty; Parliament was not sitting;
and shooting and cub-hunting were in full
force in the country.
</p>

<p>
Sooner or later one runs up against every
one in this whirligig world of ours; thus
Hammersley, still lingering aimlessly in
London, coming one day from the Horse
Guards, in crossing the east end of the Mall,
found himself suddenly face to face with her
of whom his thoughts were full&mdash;Finella
Melfort!
</p>

<p>
Finella, in a smart sealskin jacket, with
her muff slung by a silken cord round her
slender neck, a most becoming hat, the veil
of which was tied tightly and piquantly
across her short upper lip.
</p>

<p>
'Finella!'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, Vivian!'
</p>

<p>
Their exclamations and joyful surprise
were mutual, but 'the horns and hoofs of
the green-eyed monster' were still obtruding
amid the thoughts of Hammersley, though
she frankly gave him both her plump little
tightly gloved hands, which after a caressing
pressure he speedily dropped, rather to the
surprise of the charming proprietor thereof.
</p>

<p>
'Did you know I was in London?' she asked.
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;too well.'
</p>

<p>
'And yet made no effort to see&mdash;to write
to me!'
</p>

<p>
'I knew not where to find you.'
</p>

<p>
'You might have inquired&mdash;that is, if you
cared to know.'
</p>

<p>
'Cared&mdash;oh, Finella!'
</p>

<p>
'And your wound&mdash;your cruel wound!
Have you recovered from it?'
</p>

<p>
'Nearly so&mdash;thus I have just been at the
Horse Guards about going on foreign service
again.
</p>

<p>
'Foreign service&mdash;again?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes; there are wounds deeper and more
lasting than any an enemy can inflict.'
</p>

<p>
She evidently did not understand his mood.
</p>

<p>
'Are you not rash, Vivian, to be out in a
day so chill as this?' she said.
</p>

<p>
'A little chill, fog, or rain, more or less,
are trifles to one whose thoughts are all of
sad and bitter things.'
</p>

<p>
'Vivian?&mdash;your wound, was it a severe one?'
</p>

<p>
'Very.  I received a shot that was meant
for the assassination of another.'
</p>

<p>
'Who?'
</p>

<p>
'Florian; your friend Miss Carlyon's lover,
who, poor fellow, I hear sailed from Durban
in a bad way.'
</p>

<p>
'Why do you look and speak so coldly,
Vivian&mdash;Vivian?' she asked, with her slender
fingers interlaced, while he certainly eyed her
wistfully, curiously, and even angrily.
</p>

<p>
'Why?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes,' said she, impetuously.  'Why are
you so cruel&mdash;so hard to me?' she added,
with a sob in her voice, as she placed a hand
on his arm and looked earnestly up in his
face.  'Surely it is not for me to plead thus?'
</p>

<p>
'Why are you so touched?'
</p>

<p>
'Can you ask, while treating me thus?'
</p>

<p>
'Like a thorough Scotch girl, you answer
one question by asking another.'
</p>

<p>
'Well, in constancy men certainly do not
bear the palm,' said she, drawing back a pace,
and inserting her hands in her muff.
</p>

<p>
'I think you should be the last to taunt
me, at all events, as appearances go.'
</p>

<p>
There was a moment's silence, for both
were too honest and true to have acquired
what has been termed 'the useful and social
art of talking platitudes' when their hearts
were full.
</p>

<p>
'And this is our long-looked-forward-to
meeting?' she said, reproachfully.
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;alas!'
</p>

<p>
'Why do you regard me&mdash;not with the
furious rage that possessed you on quitting
Craigengowan&mdash;but with coldness, doubt,
indifference?'
</p>

<p>
'Indifference!  Oh, no, Finella.'
</p>

<p>
'Doubt&mdash;suspicion, then?'
</p>

<p>
'It may be,' he replied with a doggedness
that certainly was not natural to him.
</p>

<p>
'What <i>have</i> I done?' asked the girl, sorely
piqued now.
</p>

<p>
'Nothing, perhaps,' he replied shrinking
from putting his thoughts into words.
</p>

<p>
'Can it be that you are changeable and
inconstant?  When you saw me, and knew
that I was in London, why did you not come
to me at once?'
</p>

<p>
'Because I knew not where or with whom
you were residing.'
</p>

<p>
'Did you go to Fettercairn House?'
</p>

<p>
'No.'
</p>

<p>
'Why?' she asked curtly, for <i>her</i> suspicions
were being kindled now.
</p>

<p>
'I knew the family were not in town.'
</p>

<p>
'Then you might have asked for Lady
Drumshoddy, and, if not, somehow have
heard&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'By tipping the butler or Mr. James Plush?'
</p>

<p>
'If I wanted to do anything I would grasp
at the first chance of achieving it,' said Finella,
her dark eyes sparkling now.
</p>

<p>
'Men are seldom creatures of impulse.  I
reasoned over the matter, and put two and
two together.'
</p>

<p>
'Reason generally urges men to do what
they wish.  But what do you mean by putting
two and two together?'
</p>

<p>
'Well, frankly, I referred to you and Major
Garallan.'
</p>

<p>
'Do you make <i>four</i> of us?  Vivian, you
are absurd,' said Finella, after a little pause,
during which she coloured and stamped a
little foot impatiently on the ground.
</p>

<p>
'Perhaps,' said he sadly and wearily; 'but
I heard so much at the Clubs and elsewhere
that I knew not what to think.'
</p>

<p>
'About us you mean&mdash;Cousin Ronald and me?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'You heard&mdash;what?'
</p>

<p>
'That you were about to be married&mdash;that
is the long and the short of it.'
</p>

<p>
His face crimsoned with annoyance as he
spoke; but hers grew pale.
</p>

<p>
'And you, Vivian&mdash;you believed this?' she
asked mournfully and reproachfully.
</p>

<p>
'Much that I saw seemed to confirm it.
You and he were so much together.'
</p>

<p>
'How unfortunate I am to have been
suspected by you twice!  Ronald is only my
cousin.'
</p>

<p>
'So was that precious Shafto!'
</p>

<p>
'Why hark back upon that episode?' she
asked, piteously.  'Have I offended you?
Misunderstanding between us seems to have
become our normal state.'
</p>

<p>
'Your cousin may&mdash;nay, I doubt not, loves
you, Finella; but why do you permit him to
do so?'
</p>

<p>
'Can I help it?  Ronald was a kind of
brother to me&mdash;nothing more,' she continued,
ignoring&mdash;perhaps at that moment forgetting&mdash;his
recent proposal; 'but my heart has
never for a moment wandered from you.
See!' she added, while quickly and nervously
stripping the kid glove from her right hand,
'your engagement ring has never, for a
second even, been off my finger since first
you placed it there.'
</p>

<p>
'My darling&mdash;my darling!' he exclaimed,
as all his heart went forth towards her.  'Oh,
Finella! what I suffered when I thought I
had again lost you!  Yet I would almost
undergo it all again&mdash;for this!' he added, as
he passionately kissed her, after a swift glance
round to see that no one was nigh.
</p>

<p>
So the reconciliation was complete; all
doubts were dissipated, and they lingered
long together, talking of themselves and a
thousand kindred topics, in which foreign
service was not included; and more complete
it was, when, after escorting her home (Lady
Drumshoddy being absent at Exeter Hall),
in the solitude of the drawing-room, they had
a sweeter lingering still, Finella's head resting
on his shoulder, the touch of her cheek thrilling
through him, and like some tender and
tuneful melody her soft cooing voice seemed
to vibrate in his head and heart together.
</p>

<p>
So they were united again after all!
</p>

<p>
At last they had to separate, and looking
forward to a visit on the morrow, Hammersley,
seeming to tread on air, in a state of
radiance, both in face and mind, hurried
across the square to the Club, where he came
suddenly upon Villiers, whom he had not
seen for some days, and who seemed rather
curiously to resent his evident state of high
spirits.
</p>

<p>
'Well, Villiers,' said he, 'you do look glum,
by Jove!  What is the matter now&mdash;the
Wolseley ring, and all that&mdash;the service going
to the dogs!'
</p>

<p>
'You know deuced well that it <i>has</i> gone&mdash;went
with the regimental system.  No; it is
a cursed affair of my own.  I have been
robbed.'
</p>

<p>
'Robbed&mdash;how&mdash;and of what?'
</p>

<p>
'My pocket-book, containing some valuable
papers and more than £500 in Bank of
England notes.'
</p>

<p>
'Good heavens!  I hope you have the numbers?'
</p>

<p>
'No&mdash;never noted such a thing in my life.
Who but a careful screw would do so?'
</p>

<p>
'How came it about?'
</p>

<p>
'Well, you see,' said Villiers slowly, while
manipulating a cigar, 'I took a run over to
Ostend, and there, as the devil would have it,
at the Casino, and afterwards in the mail boat
to Dover, I fell in with a charming Belgienne,
an awfully pretty and seductive creature, who
was on her way to London and quite alone.
We had rather a pronounced flirtation, and
exchanged photos&mdash;an act of greater folly on
her part than on mine, as the event proved;
for, after taking mine from my pocket-book
(which she could see was full of notes), I
never saw the latter again.  I dropped asleep,
but awoke when the tickets were collected&mdash;awoke
to find that she had slipped out at
some intermediate station, and the pocket-book,
which I had placed in my breast-pocket,
was gone too!  There had been no one else
in the carriage with me&mdash;indeed I had quietly
tipped the guard to arrange it so.  Thus, as
no trace of it could be found, after the most
careful search, she must have deftly abstracted
it.  Here is her photo&mdash;a deuced dear work
of art to me!'
</p>

<p>
'She is pretty, indeed!' exclaimed Hammersley;
'such a quantity of beautiful fair hair!'
</p>

<p>
'It was dark golden.'
</p>

<p>
'Surely it was rash of her to give you this?'
</p>

<p>
'It was vanity, perhaps, when the idea of
theft had not occurred to her.'
</p>

<p>
'Throw it in the fire.'
</p>

<p>
'Not at all.'
</p>

<p>
'What do you mean to do with it&mdash;preserve
the likeness of a mere adventuress?'
</p>

<p>
'I shall give it to the police as a clue.  It
may lead to the recovery of my money, and,
what is of more consequence to me, my
correspondence.'
</p>

<p>
So the photo of the pretty Belgienne was
handed over to the authorities; but neither
Villiers nor Hammersley could quite foresee
what it was to lead to.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVII.
<br /><br />
FLORIAN DYING.
</h3>

<p>
After her flight from Craigengowan to
London, Dulcie had found shelter in the
same house wherein she had lodged after
leaving Revelstoke, in a gloomy alley that
opens northward off Oxford Street.  The
vicar, on whose protection and interest she
relied, was not in London, and would be
absent therefrom for fully a month; so she
had written to Mr. Pentreath, who quietly,
but firmly rebuked her for her folly in
quitting Craigengowan, and expressed his
dismay that she should be alone and
unprotected in London, and urged her to come
to him, in Devonshire, at once.
</p>

<p>
But Dulcie remembered his slender income,
his pinched household, and
notwithstanding all the dear and sad associations of
Revelstoke, she remained in London, thinking
that amid its mighty world something
would be sure to turn up.
</p>

<p>
The solitude of her little room was so
great that times there were when she thought
she might go mad from pure inanition and
loneliness; but greater still seemed the solitude
of the streets, which, crowded as they were
by myriads passing to and fro, were
without one friend for her.
</p>

<p>
She was not without her occasional <i>chateaux
en Espagne</i>&mdash;dreams of relations, rich but as
yet unknown, who would seek her out and
cast a sunshine on her life; but how sordid
seemed all her surroundings after the comfort
and luxury, the splendour and stateliness, of
Craigengowan!
</p>

<p>
Dulcie had once had her girlish dreams of
life in London, at a time when the chances
of her ever being there were remote
indeed&mdash;dreams that were as the glittering scenes
in a pantomime; and now, in her loneliness,
she was appalled by the great Babylon, so
terrible in its vastness, so hideous in its
monotony as a wilderness of bricks and
bustle by day, bustle and gas by night, with
its huge and dusky dome over all, with its
tens upon thousands of vehicles of every
kind&mdash;a whirling vortex, cleft in two by a
river of mud and slime, where the corpses of
suicides and the murdered are ploughed up
by steamers and dredges&mdash;a river that perhaps
hides more crime and dreadful secrets than
any other in Europe; and amid the seething
masses of the great Babylon she felt herself
as a grain of sand on the seashore.
</p>

<p>
Our neighbours next door know us not,
nor care to know; and to the postman, the
milkman, and the message-boy we are only
'a number' as long as we pay&mdash;nothing more.
</p>

<p>
So times there were when Dulcie longed
intensely for the home of her childhood, with
its shady Devonshire lanes redolent of ripe
apples, wild honeysuckle, and the sycamore-trees,
and for the midges dancing merrily in
the clear sunshine above the stream in which
she and Florian were wont to fish together:
and but for Shafto and Lady Fettercairn she
would have gladly hailed Craigengowan, with
its ghost-haunted Howe, its old gate of the
legend, Queen Mary's Thorn, and all their
lonely adjuncts, could she but share them
with Finella; but she was all unaware that
the latter was there no longer.
</p>

<p>
Her little stock of money was wearing
out, with all her care and frugality, and her
whole hope lay in the return of the vicar,
who, too probably, would also reproach her
with precipitation.
</p>

<p>
'Things will come right yet&mdash;they always
do&mdash;if one knows how to wait and trust in
God,' said Dulcie to herself, hopefully but
tearfully; 'and when two love each other,'
she added, thinking of Florian, 'they may
beat Fate itself.'
</p>

<p>
Dulcie had not written to Finella, as she
was yet without distinct plans; she only
knew that she could not teach, and thus was
not 'cut out' for a governess.  Neither did
she write to Florian, as she knew not where
to address him, and, knowing not what a day
might bring forth, she could not indicate
where she was to send an answer.  So week
followed week; her sweet hopefulness began
to leave her, and a presentiment came upon
her that she would never see Florian again.
So many misfortunes had befallen her that
this would only be one more; and this
presentiment seemed to be realised, and a
dreadful shock was given, when by the
merest chance she saw in a paper a few
weeks old the same telegram concerning him
which had so excited old Mr. Kippilaw, and
which had found its way into print, as
everything seems to do nowadays.
</p>

<p>
The transport with sick and wounded was
on its homeward way; but when it arrived
would he be with it, or sleeping under the
waves?
</p>

<p>
It was a dreadful stroke for Dulcie; her
only tie to earth seemed to be passing or to
have passed away.  She had no one to
confide in, no one to condole with her, and
for a whole day never quitted her pillow;
but, 'at twenty, one must be constitutionally
very unsound if grief is to kill one, or even
to leave any permanent and abiding mark of
its presence.'  But she had to undergo the
terrible mental torture of waiting&mdash;waiting,
with idle hands, with throbbing head, and
aching heart, for the bulletin that might
crush her whole existence.  He whom she
loved with all her heart and soul, who had
been woven up with her life, since childhood,
was far away upon the sea, struggling it
might be with death, and she was not by his
pillow; and the lips, that had never aught
but soft and tender words for her, might be
now closed for ever!
</p>

<p>
Already hope had been departing, we
have said.  Her heart was now heavy as
lead, and all the brightness of youth seemed
to have gone out of her life.  She began to
feel a kind of dull apathetic misery, most
difficult to describe, yet mingled with an
aching, gnawing sense of mingled pain.
</p>

<p>
Florian dying, probably&mdash;that was the
latest intelligence of him.  How curt, how
brief, how cruel seemed that item of news,
among others!
</p>

<p>
She opened her silver locket, with the
coloured photo of him.  The artist had
caught his best expression in a happy
moment; and it was hard&mdash;oh, how hard! for
the lonely girl to believe that the loving and
smiling face, with its tender dark eyes and
crisp brown hair, was now too probably a
lifeless piece of clay, mouldering under the
waves of the tropical sea.
</p>

<p>
She had made up her mind to expect the
worst, and that she could never see him
more.
</p>

<p>
'It seems to me,' she thought, 'as if I had
ceased to be young, and had grown very old.
God help me, now!' she added, as she sank
heavily into a chair, with a deathly pale face,
and eyes that saw nothing, though staring
into the dingy brick street without; and
though Dulcie's tears came readily enough as
a general rule, in the presence of this new
and unexpected calamity, nature failed to
grant her the boon&mdash;the relief of weeping
freely.  'There is a period in all our lives,'
says a writer, 'when the heaviest grief
will hardly keep us waking; we may sink to
slumber with undried tears upon our face;
we may sob and murmur through the long
night; but still we have the happy power of
losing consciousness and gaining strength to
bear the next day's trial.'
</p>

<p>
So Dulcie, worn with heavy thought, could
find oblivion for a time, and even slept with
the roar of mighty London in her ears.
</p>

<p>
The vicar had not yet returned, so day
followed day with her, aimlessly and
hopelessly.
</p>

<p>
She thought the public prints could give
her no further tidings now.  She knew not
where to seek for intelligence, and could but
wait, dumbly, expectantly, and count the
hours as they drifted wearily past, in the
desperate longing that some tidings would
reach her at some time of her dearest, it
might be now her dead, one!
</p>

<p>
The Parks were completely empty then;
the sunshine was pleasant and warm for the
season; the grass was green and beautiful;
and lured thereby one forenoon, the pale girl
went forth for a little air, when there
occurred an extraordinary catastrophe that,
in her present weakened state of mind and
body, was fully calculated to destroy her!
</p>

<p>
The afternoon passed&mdash;the evening and
the night too, yet she did not as usual return
to her humble lodging.  The morning
dawned without a trace of her; the landlady
began to appraise her few effects; the landlord
shook his head, winked knowingly, and
said, 'She was far too pretty to live alone,'
and deemed it the old story over again&mdash;a
waif <i>lost in London</i>.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap18"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII.
<br /><br />
THE TERRIBLE MISTAKE.
</h3>

<p>
Dulcie had thought that no possible harm
could accrue to her from rambling or sitting
in that beautiful Park alone, and watching the
children playing with their hoops along the
gravelled walk.  With whom could she go?
She had no one to escort her.  She knew
not that it was not quite etiquette for a young
lady to be there alone and unattended; but
the event that occurred to her was one
which she could never have anticipated.
</p>

<p>
She had sat for some time, absorbed in
her own thoughts, on one of the rustic sofas
not far from Stanhope Gate, all unaware that
an odd-looking and mean-looking, but
carefully dressed little man had been hovering
near her, and observing her closely with his
keen small ferret-like eyes, and with an
expression of deep interest, destitute, however,
of the slightest admiration, and with a kind
of sardonic and stereotyped smile in which
mirth bore no part.
</p>

<p>
He scanned her features from time to
time, grinned to himself, and ever and anon
consulted something concealed in his hand.
</p>

<p>
'Golden hair&mdash;sealskin jacket&mdash;sable muff&mdash;hat
and feather&mdash;a silver necklet&mdash;all
right,' he muttered, and then he advanced
close towards her.
</p>

<p>
Dulcie looked up at him with surprise,
and then with an emotion of alarm, mingled
with confusion, which he was neither slow to
see nor misinterpret&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'May I ask your name?' said he in a mild tone.
</p>

<p>
'Miss Carlyon&mdash;Dulcie Carlyon.'
</p>

<p>
'Ah! you speak good English.'
</p>

<p>
'I am English.'
</p>

<p>
'And not a furriner?'
</p>

<p>
'No,' replied Dulcie in growing alarm.
</p>

<p>
'But you reside in London, just now?'
</p>

<p>
'Just now&mdash;yes,' said Dulcie, seeing that
he was comparing her face with that of a
photo in his hand.
</p>

<p>
'With your family&mdash;friends?'
</p>

<p>
'I have no family&mdash;no friends,' said Dulcie,
with a sob in her throat, and starting up to
withdraw in great alarm.
</p>

<p>
'Just so&mdash;not here, but at Ostend, perhaps.'
</p>

<p>
Thinking her questioner was mad or
intoxicated, Dulcie, in growing terror, was
about to move away when he laid a hand
very decidedly on her left arm.
</p>

<p>
'Leave me,' she exclaimed, and on looking
around her terror increased on seeing that no
male aid was near her; 'who are you that ask
these questions&mdash;that dare to molest me?'
</p>

<p>
'My name is Grabbley&mdash;Mr. Gilpin
Grabbley, of Scotland Yard&mdash;oh, you'll know
enough o' me, my dear, before I'm done with
you.  Come along: you're wanted partiklar&mdash;you
are.  Will you walk with me quietly?'
</p>

<p>
Perceiving that she was about to utter a
shriek, he grasped her arm more tightly, even
to the bruising of her soft tender skin, and
said in a sharp hissing tone:
</p>

<p>
'Don't&mdash;don't make a row: 'taint no use,
my beauty&mdash;you must come along with me.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, what do you mean?' moaned Dulcie,
almost incapable of standing now.
</p>

<p>
'Mean&mdash;why, that you are my prisoner,
that is all.'
</p>

<p>
'Am I mad or dreaming?  Oh, sir, this
is some dreadful mistake.'
</p>

<p>
'No mistake at all,' said Mr. Grabbley
tauntingly.
</p>

<p>
They were out in Park Lane now, and
Dulcie cast a despairing glance at the many
closed and shuttered windows of the mansions
there, as if she would summon aid.
</p>

<p>
'Look here, gal,' said the detective, for
such Mr. Grabbley was, 'I have orders to
arrest the original of this fotygraf&mdash;you are
that original&mdash;look! don't you see yourself,
as if in a looking-glass?'
</p>

<p>
Dulcie did look, with a kind of horrible
fascination, and recognised in it a very striking
resemblance to her face and dress&mdash;even to
the luckless silver locket and chain.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Grabbley utilised the moments of her
bewilderment.  He stopped a passing
cab&mdash;half lifted, half thrust her in.
</p>

<p>
'Marlborough Street,' said he to the driver,
and they were driven off.
</p>

<p>
'Of what am I accused?' said Dulcie, driven
desperate now.
</p>

<p>
'Robbery on a railway&mdash;that's all; and
you knows all about it&mdash;the when and the
where.'
</p>

<p>
If not the victim of some deliberate outrage,
she was certainly the victim of some
inexplicable mistake which might yet be
explained; anyway in her ignorance and
in her wild fear she strove to elicit succour
from passers-by, till Mr. Grabbley closed the
rattling glasses of the cab and held her
firmly, while, like one in a dreadful dream,
she was rapidly driven through Berkley
Square, across Bond Street and Regent
Street, to their destination, where, when the
cab stopped, she was quickly taken indoors,
through a passage, in which several police
officers and odd, repulsive-looking people of
both sexes were loitering about, and whence
she was conveyed by the inexorable Grabbley,
to whom all appeals were vain, and left
in a state of semi-stupefaction&mdash;after being
led down a long corridor, having many doors
opening on each side thereof&mdash;in a small
bare room&mdash;a den it seemed, and if not quite
a prison cell, yet dreary, cold, and comfortless
enough to suggest the idea of being one.
</p>

<p>
She heard a key turned upon her, and
felt that now&mdash;more than ever&mdash;she was a
prisoner!
</p>

<p>
She had no sense of indignation as yet&mdash;only
a wild and clamorous one of fear, or
dread, she knew not of what&mdash;of being
disgraced, and, it might be, the victim of a
mad-man's freak.  She was in utter solitude, and no
sound seemed to be there but the loud beating
of her heart.
</p>

<p>
Past grief and anxiety had rendered her
very weak and unable to withstand the tension
on her nerves caused by this astounding
accusation and catastrophe, of which she
could neither calculate nor see the end.
Then an exhaustion that was utter and
complete followed, and for a time she was
physically and mentally prostrate&mdash;in that awful
sense of desolation and heart-broken grief
that God in His mercy permits few to suffer....
So passed the night.
</p>

<p>
'A person&mdash;a gentleman,' said a commissionaire
at the Rag doubtfully to Villiers as
he entered the vestibule, 'has been waiting
here for nearly an hour for you, sir.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh&mdash;it is you, Mr.&mdash;Mr.&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Grabbley, sir,' said the little man affably,
his ferret eyes twinkling, and his vulgar face
rippling over with a smile.
</p>

<p>
'You have some news, I suppose?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, sir, I've nabbed her.'
</p>

<p>
'When?'
</p>

<p>
'Yesterday morning.'
</p>

<p>
'Where?'
</p>

<p>
'In Hyde Park&mdash;nigh Stanhope Gate.
She speaks English uncommonly well to be
a furriner.'
</p>

<p>
'That's sharp work!  You are a clever
fellow, Grabbley.  Was my pocket-book found
upon her?'
</p>

<p>
'We did not search her, but she is locked up
at Marlborough Street, where I would like you
to see and identify her before making out the
matter in the charge sheet.'
</p>

<p>
'All right&mdash;get a cab.  Come with me,
Hammersley, and I'll show you my little
Belgienne.'
</p>

<p>
Hammersley went unwillingly, as it was
pretty close on the time he had now begun
to visit Finella at her grandmother's
residence, and he cast longing eyes at the
windows of the latter as he and his two
companions were driven out of the square.
</p>

<p>
'A horrid atmosphere, and a horrid place
in all its details,' he muttered, when the
scene of Dulcie's detention was reached, and
throwing away the fag end of a cheap cigar
Mr. Grabbley, with an expression of no
small satisfaction, puckering his visage,
unlocked and threw open the door&mdash;a sound
which roused Dulcie from her stupefied
state&mdash;and starting up she stood before them,
trembling in every fibre, with a hunted
expression in her dark blue eyes and a
gathering hope in her breast, to find herself
confronted by two such men of unexceptionable
appearance and bearing as Hammersley
and Villiers, who raised his hat, and turning
with astonishment and some dismay to the
police official said sharply:
</p>

<p>
'This is some great&mdash;some truly infernal
mistake!'
</p>

<p>
'A mistake&mdash;how, sir?' asked Grabbley.
</p>

<p>
'This young lady is <i>not</i> the person whose
photo I gave you.'
</p>

<p>
'They seems as like as two peas.'
</p>

<p>
'The likeness, I admit, is great, but the
Belgian girl, I told you, could not speak
a word of English, or scarcely so.  I have
to offer you a thousand apologies, though the
mistake is not mine, but that of this man,'
said Villiers, bowing low to Dulcie, greatly
impressed by the sweetness of her beauty
and terror of the predicament in which she
had been placed.
</p>

<p>
'So it's a mistake after all, young gal,'
growled Mr. Grabbley, with intense disappointment
and reluctance to relinquish his prey.
</p>

<p>
'And may I go, sir?' said Dulcie piteously
to Villiers.
</p>

<p>
'Most certainly&mdash;you are free,' replied
Villiers, who was again about to apologize
and explain, but the girl, like a hunted
creature, drew her veil tightly across her
tear-blotched face, rushed along the dingy
corridor, and gained the street in an instant.
</p>

<p>
That she was a lady in every sense of tone
and bearing was evident, and Villiers felt
overcome with shame and contrition, and
swore in pretty round terms at the
crestfallen Grabbley.
</p>

<p>
'This is a devil of a mistake!' said the
latter as he scratched his head in dire
perplexity.
</p>

<p>
'A mistake we have not, perhaps, heard
the end of.  Who is she?' asked Villiers.
</p>

<p>
'I don't know.'
</p>

<p>
'Did she give you no name?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;here it is,' said Grabbley, producing
a dirty note-book; 'Dulcie Carlyon.'
</p>

<p>
'A curious and uncommon name.'
</p>

<p>
'Who do you say&mdash;Dulcie Carlyon?'
exclaimed Hammersley, who had hitherto
been silent, starting forward; and on the
name being repeated to him once or twice,
'Great Heaven!' he exclaimed, 'if it should
be the same!'
</p>

<p>
'Same what&mdash;or who?'
</p>

<p>
'The girl to whom Florian is engaged:
you remember Florian of ours.'
</p>

<p>
'Of course I do.'
</p>

<p>
'Golden hair, blue eyes, under middle
height (how often he has described her to
me), and then the name&mdash;Dulcie Carlyon; it
must be she&mdash;let us overtake her!  What an
astounding introduction!'
</p>

<p>
But that was easier proposed than
accomplished.  On gaining the street the two
officers saw not a trace of Dulcie Carlyon, so
all hope of discovering her address was
gone.
</p>

<p>
How Dulcie made her way back to her
obscure lodgings she scarcely knew; but she
was long and seriously ill after this startling
event.
</p>

<p>
There she felt as much at home as a
creature so poor and friendless could feel.
Often she lay abed and seemed unconscious,
but she was not so.  Her eyes were wide
open, and their gaze wandered about; her
lips were generally dry and quivering.  She
was in the state which generally comes after
a severe mental shock; her mind refused to
grasp the situation.
</p>

<p>
Until a drink was given her by Ellen,
the kind little maid of all work, she
sometimes knew not how parched her throat
was&mdash;how sorely athirst she had been.
</p>

<p>
She was afraid to be left alone after that
horrible accusation.  In her nervousness she
feared that she might see her double&mdash;feel a
touch, and on turning find herself face to face
with her own likeness, as that evil Lord of
Fettercairn did who sold his country.
</p>

<p>
Finella's astonishment to hear from
Hammersley the story of where and under what
circumstances he had met Dulcie Carlyon
was only equalled by his own on learning that
Florian, his comrade and brother-officer in
the Zulu war, and whilom private soldier in
his company of the 24th, was heir to a
peerage, and the cousin of his affianced wife,
Finella Melfort.
</p>

<p>
For so it was.  Lord and Lady Fettercairn
had undergone so much in the
mismanagement of family matters latterly, and
in years long past, that they were now well
disposed to let Finella alone, and in all
conscience they could not expect her to
give to Florian (if he ever returned) the love
she had never given to the now vanished
Shafto.
</p>

<p>
'Vivian, you must find out the address of
dear Dulcie,' said she.
</p>

<p>
'If I can.'
</p>

<p>
'You must.  I shall want her as one of
my bridesmaids.'
</p>

<p>
From this we may presume that matters
between these two were all in fair training
now.
</p>

<p>
'Your wish would delight Villiers, my
groomsman, who has been sorrowing about
her ever since the time of that terrible
mistake.'

<h3>
CHAPTER XIX.
<br /><br />
DULCIE'S VISITOR.
</h3>

<p>
On an afternoon subsequent to this episode
Dulcie was lost in a day-dream, born of her
own sad thoughts, her soft blue eyes fixed
vacantly on the hideous and dingy brick
edifices of the thoroughfare in which she
dwelt; and when roused therefrom by the
little maid of all work, she gazed at her with
a somewhat dazed expression.
</p>

<p>
'What is it, Ellen?' she asked.
</p>

<p>
'A gentleman, miss, wishes to see you.'
</p>

<p>
Alarm&mdash;dread, she knew not of what, was
her first idea now.
</p>

<p>
'Who is he?' she asked.
</p>

<p>
'I don't know, miss.'
</p>

<p>
'Is he old or young?'
</p>

<p>
'Young.'
</p>

<p>
'Then he can't be the vicar?'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, lawk, no, miss, he ain't a bit like a
clergyman,' replied the housemaid, laughing.
</p>

<p>
'Ask his business, Ellen.'
</p>

<p>
She was almost relapsing into her dream
again, when she was startled by seeing a
man appear beside her.
</p>

<p>
'Dulcie?' said a voice, that made her
heart thrill.
</p>

<p>
She sprang up to find herself confronted
by a gentleman, whose face, though thin and
worn, seemed deeply tanned by the sun, so
that his scorched neck was absolutely red;
his dark moustache was thick and heavy,
his shoulders broad and square.
</p>

<p>
'Dearest Dulcie, don't you know me?'
said he, holding out his hands and arms.
</p>

<p>
'Florian&mdash;is this you&mdash;really you?'
</p>

<p>
'I thought you would not quite forget me.'
</p>

<p>
'Forget you!' said Dulcie, in a low and
piercing voice, as she fell upon his breast,
and his loving arms went closely round her.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, Florian, I did not know you were in
England!'
</p>

<p>
'We were landed at Plymouth three days
ago.  I got your address from good old Paul
Pentreath, procured leave of absence, and
came on here without a moment's delay, my
own darling.'
</p>

<p>
For some minutes neither could find words
to speak, so supreme was the mutual happiness
of the sudden reunion.
</p>

<p>
'How brown you are! but how thin, and how
much older you look!' said Dulcie, surveying
him with bright but tearful eyes.  'I can
scarcely believe you to be the same Florian
that left me only a year ago or so.'
</p>

<p>
'Ay, Dulcie, pet; but soldiering, especially
soldiering in the ranks, takes a lot out of a
fellow.  But I am the same Florian that left
you then, with a heavy and hopeless heart
indeed.'
</p>

<p>
'And now&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Now I shall leave you no more.'
</p>

<p>
'What dreadful places you must have been
in, Florian; what dangers you have faced;
what sufferings undergone, my love!'
</p>

<p>
'The thought of you lightened and
brightened them all to me, Dulcie,' said he,
while into her bright little English face came
that wonderful and adoring smile only
possible on the lips and in the eyes of a
woman who is in love, and for the object of
her love.
</p>

<p>
She told him of her simple plans and
humble prospects, of her hope in the vicar,
why she had left Craigengowan, and how
she came to be in that poor and cheap
lodging-room near Oxford Street.
</p>

<p>
'We must not lose sight of each other
now, my darling,' said he, as she nestled her
face on his breast.  'Let us get married at
once, love, and then it must be service in
India for me.  Are you ready to face heat, it
may be fever, and Heaven knows what more,
Dulcie?'
</p>

<p>
'Every peril, if with you!'
</p>

<p>
'My brave little soldier's wife!  But
suppose we grow tired of each other?'
</p>

<p>
'You wicked wag!&mdash;why think of such a thing?'
</p>

<p>
'Married folks do sometimes,' said he,
laughing.
</p>

<p>
'Then we should part&mdash;I would run away.'
</p>

<p>
'As a preliminary to that we must be
united, Dulcie; so when will you be ready
to marry me?'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, Florian!'
</p>

<p>
'You must say&mdash;we have little time to lose.'
</p>

<p>
'I have no trousseau to get&mdash;and no money
for it&mdash;we are so poor, Florian.'
</p>

<p>
'But rich in love&mdash;well then&mdash;when?'
</p>

<p>
'I don't know,' was the shy, coy answer.
</p>

<p>
'This day three weeks&mdash;I can afford even
a special license, Dulcie.'
</p>

<p>
'So be it, dear Florian.'
</p>

<p>
'Then I shall write to good old Paul
Pentreath about it, and then we must
resolutely think of turning our steps to India.
We could not afford to live at home.'
</p>

<p>
Their little plans&mdash;little, though of vast
importance to them&mdash;were all arranged, and
discussed so sweetly, so lovingly, again and
again, and at last he left her for his hotel,
which was not far off, in Oxford Street, with
a promise to call for her again betimes on
the morrow; and to Dulcie it seemed as if
the sun had come with a glorious burst of
radiance at last into the cloudy atmosphere
of her life; that joy had come with it; and
that, sorrow and tears&mdash;save those of
happiness&mdash;had gone for ever.
</p>

<p>
So, in three weeks the life of Dulcie
Carlyon would be over; and the life of
Dulcie MacIan would begin.
</p>

<p>
Dulcie MacIan&mdash;how odd it seemed to sound!
</p>

<p>
And so, at the appointed time, Mr. Paul
Pentreath, summoned to London for the special
occasion, tied the 'fatal knot' of the
matrimonial noose for these two young people;
and Dulcie, as in a dream, heard him ask:
</p>

<p>
'Wilt thou have this man to be thy
wedded husband, to live together after
God's ordinance, in the holy estate of matrimony?'
</p>

<p>
And in a clear and confident tone little
Dulcie said, 'I will,' as she loved, frankly&mdash;loved
'as a fair honest English maiden may
with her heart on her lips, and all her soul
shining out of her truthful eyes.'
</p>

<p>
So the marriage passed quietly; there
were no lawyers, dressmakers, outfitters, and
all those other folks who never keep time;
no attendants, save Dulcie's landlady, the
clerk, and honest Tom Tyrrell, whose 'time
being out,' contrived to turn up about this
crisis to wish, with all the ardour of his
gallant heart, his whilom comrade and officer,
with his fair young bride, 'God speed;' and
after a quiet little honeymoon at Richmond&mdash;no
further off&mdash;Florian set forth to the
Horse Guards for the purpose of effecting an
exchange to a regiment in India; but a letter
that came to him altered all his views and
plans.
</p>

<p>
It was from Mr. Kenneth Kippilaw, W.S.,
who had seen the marriage announced in a
public print, and had written at once to
Florian and to Lord Fettercairn.
</p>

<p>
When Abou Hassan, the merchant of
Bagdad, woke up on that remarkable morning,
and he found himself in the palace of
Haroun al Raschid, and treated as the latter
by all the beautiful ladies of the Court, and
the black slaves around his couch, he was
scarcely more astonished than our poor
Lieutenant of Infantry, when he found
himself to be the heir of Craigengowan and
Fettercairn!
</p>

<p>
He then knew all about Shafto's villainy,
yet in the gentleness of his spirit he joined
with Dulcie in saying:
</p>

<p>
'Poor creature!  God help and forgive him,
as freely as I do.'
</p>

<p>
Sooth to say, Dulcie was perhaps less
astonished on finding Florian was the true
heir; she had ever thought there was some
mystery in the new position and new
relationship, so suddenly assumed by the wily
Shafto, whose tissue of falsehoods had, as
usual in such cases, broken down by an
unthought-of point.
</p>

<p>
Amid the sudden splendour of his prospects,
such was his simplicity of character,
that one of Florian's first thoughts was of a
cosy cottage at Craigengowan for his comrade
Tom Tyrrell!
</p>

<p>
The news spread like wildfire through all
the Mearns, Angus, and everywhere else.  It
proved a great godsend, and the vicinity of
Inverbervie was besieged by folks connected
with the press, all eager to glean the last
authentic information from Craigengowan, and
even Grapeston, the butler, and MacCrupper,
the head groom, were interviewed and
treated&mdash;the former with wine, and the latter
copiously with whisky and water&mdash;on the
subject.
</p>

<p>
To Lady Fettercairn the marriage of
Florian proved, of course, a cause of bitter
mortification.
</p>

<p>
'Another mesalliance&mdash;like father, like
son!' she exclaimed; 'now indeed we shall
be associated with Freethinkers, franchise
folks, dynamiters, and all kinds of dreadful
people!' she wailed out.
</p>

<p>
The first alleged and hurriedly accepted
heir had proved a ruinous blackleg; the
second and true one was Flora MacIan's son
beyond all doubt&mdash;a gallant young fellow,
who had 'gone through the ranks to a
commission!' but, alas! he had married Dulcie
Carlyon&mdash;the Devonshire lawyer's daughter&mdash;her
'companion,' whom she had treated
with no small contumely at Craigengowan,
where she was now to be welcomed as a
bride and the future Lady Fettercairn!
</p>

<p>
It was all too much for the aristocratic
brain of the present holder of that rank.
</p>

<p>
She sat in her boudoir at Craigengowan;
it was small, but wonderfully pretty; the
chairs were all of ivory and gilt; the walls
hung with pale blue silk, embroidered with
flowers; and she thought ruefully of the time
when&mdash;if her Lord predeceased her&mdash;she
would have to quit all that, and take up her
abode at Finella Lodge, the humble
dower-house&mdash;giving place to Dulcie Carlyon.  It
was all too horrible to think of!
</p>

<p>
But the couple were coming, and already
she could hear the distant cheers of the
tenantry.
</p>

<p>
Several young ladies&mdash;among them the
daughters of Mr. Kippilaw&mdash;were seated
about the room in expectation and in lounging
attitudes, their garden bonnets or riding
habits showing how they had been recently
occupied.
</p>

<p>
A distant sound&mdash;was it of carriage-wheels&mdash;made
her lapdog bark.
</p>

<p>
'Down, Snap&mdash;be quiet,' said Lady Fettercairn
with more asperity than was her wont
to that plethoric and pampered cur.
</p>

<p>
The volunteers were under arms on the lawn
to salute Florian Melfort as a hero from
Zululand; and a salute to his bride was boomed
forth from an old battery of 6-pounders
on the terrace; a banner was flaunting
on the old tower, above all the vanes and
turrets; bells were clashing in the distant
kirk spire, and the cheers of the Craigengowan
tenantry rang up amid the ancient
trees in welcome to the heir of Fettercairn
and his winsome young wife.
</p>

<p>
Lord Fettercairn received them at the door
with what grace he might; but the hands of
many others were held forth to him, among
others those of old Kenneth Kippilaw,
Madelon Galbraith, the aged butler, and
Sandy MacCrupper.
</p>

<p>
All shadows had fled away, and the bright
sunshine of heaven was over Craigengowan
and in the hearts of all there.
</p>

<p>
Even Lady Fettercairn, when she met
Florian and saw how like her youngest son
and his portrait he looked, felt all that she
had of a mother's heart go forth to him as it
had never done to the vanished Shafto; while
Florian, modest and gentle Florian, whose
heart had never quailed before the enemy,
now felt, as he said to Dulcie, somewhat
'dashed' on being confronted by this tall and
aristocratic grandmother amid such splendid
surroundings.
</p>

<p>
Dulcie recalled with wonder the humble
position she had held at Craigengowan, and
the many fears and mortifications to which
she had been subjected by Lady Fettercairn
and Shafto till the eventful morning of her
flight, and how strange it seemed to her to
be able to act as guide and cicerone over his
own patrimony to Florian, and to show him
that she was quite at home in that hitherto
unknown land to him&mdash;the Howe of the
Mearns!
</p>

<p>
And in a week or two more Finella and
Hammersley were coming thither on their
honeymoon trip.

Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
